### 4203: Remove prod logging for /api/v1/health (#1391)

# PR Summary

This PR refactors the API initialization and logging configuration to improve maintainability and reduce log noise. Major changes include:

- In src/backend/api.py:
  - Improved import organization by removing duplicates and reordering modules for clarity.
  - Added new route registrations for several admin and UI endpoints (e.g., diagnostics, organizations, RBAC, scrubbers, settings, users, approvals, assessment options, assets proxy, attestations, block library, guidelines, model page layouts, etc.), ensuring a more structured configuration of the API.
  - Adjusted error handler registration and context setup to streamline the initialization sequence.
  - Introduced a lambda filter on the werkzeug logger to filter out health check requests from noisy logging.

- In src/backend/utils/logging/structlog.py:
  - Modified the request logging behavior to log the '/api/v1/health' endpoint at debug level while keeping info level logging for other endpoints. This helps reduce clutter in the logs from frequent health check pings.

Overall, the changes aim to enhance code clarity, maintainability, and logging efficiency without impacting the core functionality of the API.

### Fix metadata figure query (#1371)

# PR Summary

This pull request enhances the metadata filtering mechanism in the database query for figures. The primary functional change is an update to the condition that constructs filters from metadata keys. When the metadata value is a timestamp (either a datetime or a date object), the code now casts the JSON value (extracted as a string) to a DateTime type using the database's casting functionality. This ensures that comparisons between timestamp values in the metadata and the provided datetime/date objects are performed correctly.

Other changes include a minor version bump in the project configuration file (pyproject.toml), but the focus of this PR is on the improved handling of timestamp metadata.

### Enhance metadata filtering in Figure model to handle timestamp values… (#1393)

# PR Summary

This pull request enhances the metadata filtering in the `get_latest_figures` function by adding special handling for timestamp values. The changes introduce a check to determine if the metadata value is a `datetime` or `date` object. If it is, the code casts the JSON string value to a datetime type using SQLAlchemy's `func.cast` and compares it with the provided value. If not, the value is converted to a string for comparison. This improvement allows for accurate filtering of records based on timestamp metadata, ensuring that date and time values are correctly interpreted and compared within the query.

### feat(templates): Improve template swap-merge experience (#1383)

# PR Summary

This PR introduces new functionality to allow users to create and swap documentation templates for inventory models. The major changes include:

1. A new method, create_template_version_from_json, added to the inventory model code. This method accepts a document type and sections data to update the current template version, then saves a new template version via an internal helper method.

2. Three new HTTP POST endpoints added to the UI routing layer for the following document types:
   - model_documentation
   - validation_report
   - monitoring

   Each endpoint maps to a common helper function (_create_and_swap_template) that performs several key actions:
   - Validates the provided document type against allowed values.
   - Retrieves and verifies the inventory model based on the current user's organization and membership (with an authorization override for model admins).
   - Checks for the presence of required fields (to_template_cuid, to_template_version, and new_template_json) in the JSON payload.
   - Retrieves the target template and its version, performs the swap by calling the swap_template method on the inventory model, and finally, calls create_template_version_from_json to update the template.
   - Appropriately handles errors by logging and raising a BadRequestError with relevant messages.

The functional changes focus on enhancing the templatization process and ensuring that proper validations and error handling are in place for swapping templates based on a provided JSON structure.

### [SC-9370] Date Localization Support (#1337)

# PR Summary

This pull request introduces enhancements to the user settings by adding a new locale configuration field. Key changes include:

1. Database Migration:
   - A new Alembic migration is added to update the default value of the `ui_settings` column in the `users` table, setting it to `{"locale": "en"}` for future inserts.
   - The migration updates existing records to include the locale setting if it is missing, ensuring that all users have a default locale value.
   - A downgrade path is provided to revert the default back to an empty JSON object if needed.

2. Application Code Update:
   - The `ui_settings` column in the User model is modified to use `{"locale": "en"}` as its default value.
   - The JSON schema used for validating `ui_settings` is updated to include a new property `locale` of type string, ensuring that the field conforms to the expected format.

These changes ensure a consistent handling of locale configurations throughout the system and improve the robustness of user settings management.

### hotfix: add more db connections to prevent pool exhaustion (#1389)

# PR Summary

This PR enhances the backend API configuration by introducing environment-based settings for SQLAlchemy's connection pooling. The Flask app now retrieves the values for SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE and SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW from environment variables, defaulting to 25 and 15 respectively when the variables are not set. This improvement enables dynamic tuning of database connection pooling, which can optimize performance and resource usage in different deployment scenarios.

### Update README.md to include agents (#1384)

# PR Summary

This pull request enhances the project's README by providing additional setup instructions to include dependent repositories. Developers are now guided to clone both the "agents" and "frontend" repositories alongside the backend repository. An additional note explains that if the "/agents" repository is not found, it must be cloned in the same parent directory as the backend to satisfy dependency requirements.

These clarifications aim to improve the developer onboarding process and prevent issues caused by missing repository dependencies.

### [SC-9264] Model Inventory Sort by Last Updated (#1376)

# PR Summary

This PR introduces functional enhancements to the inventory model API. The changes include:

1. Adding two new fields, `updated_at` and `documentation_updated_at`, to the inventory model schema. This enables tracking of when the models and their associated documentation are updated.

2. Updating the GET endpoint for inventory models to allow sorting by the `documentation_updated_at` field. When this sort parameter is used, the query joins the `Event` table and uses a correlated subquery to determine the most recent update time for model documentation (i.e., events with `target_type` set to "ModelDocument").

These changes enhance usability by allowing clients to more precisely order models based on documentation updates.

### Cachafla/sc 9634/regression cannot download documents (#1380)

# PR Summary

This PR updates the UI reporting endpoint related to report generation. The key functional change is in the authorization logic for generating different types of reports. Previously, the endpoint applied a generic authorization check for downloading reports. With these changes:

- The top-level authorization decorator is now set to the generic action "read" rather than "download_report".

- Fine-grained authorization is enforced inside the method based on the specific document type. For document types "documentation-report" and "monitoring-report", the endpoint explicitly checks for the "download_doc" permission. For document type "validation-report", it checks for the "download_vr" permission.

- If the document type provided does not match any of the expected values, the system raises a BadRequestError, ensuring only valid report types are processed.

- The exception handling is updated to catch and pass-through the BadRequestError separately, while still handling other exceptions appropriately.

### hotfix: add more db connections to prevent pool exhaustion (#1388)

#### What
Increases database connection pool default size and upper limit

#### Release Notes
Two new environment variables are available to the API server:

SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE

Defaults to 25, 15 respectively. These are passed directly to `app.config` and used by flask-sqlalchemy.

# PR Summary

This PR introduces configurable settings for the SQLAlchemy connection pool in the Flask backend API. Two new configuration parameters, SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE and SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW, are set via environment variables with default values of 25 and 15 respectively. This allows operators to dynamically adjust the connection pool settings based on deployment needs without modifying the source code.

By leveraging environment variables, the implementation enhances flexibility for managing database connections, particularly under varied load conditions. If the environment variables are not present, the system uses the provided defaults, ensuring continuity in functionality.

### [SC-9264] Model Inventory Sort by Last Updated (#1326)

#### External Release Notes
Adds new Sort columns to Inventory Model List `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`

# PR Summary

This PR introduces two new sorting criteria in the Model Inventory page. Specifically, it adds sorting options for both the "Updated Date" and the "Documentation Updated Date" fields. Each new sorting option allows data to be arranged in two possible orders: 

- Latest first (descending order)
- Oldest first (ascending order)

These enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing sorting mechanism by following the same structure and format used for other available sorts. The changes are confined to the addition of sorting options within the UI component located in `src/pages/ModelInventory/index.tsx`, ensuring that users have more flexibility in how they view and manage model-related data.

# PR Summary

This PR introduces significant improvements in how dates are formatted and displayed across various parts of the application. The changes include the creation and adoption of a new reusable component, FormattedDate, and a custom hook, useFormattedDateAndTime. These are used to replace direct calls to old formatting utilities (like displayFormattedDateAndTime) throughout the codebase. Functional updates include:

- In the main app, current UI localization settings are uploaded to localStorage on user change.
- New reusable admin components (OrganizationRow, RoleRow, and UserRow) are added for displaying organization, role, and user information respectively. These components simplify the table row implementations within admin pages.
- The date formatting across admin pages, user views, activity feed, and various modals (such as block metrics, test driven modals, and document blocks) now use the FormattedDate component to support localization.
- Update of the custom date picker in the custom fields to load locale dynamically and use FormattedDate for value display.
- Improvements in the template, workflow execution, and profile pages to support localized date displays and user-selected locale options.

These changes provide better code modularity and consistency in date handling, ensuring that date and time values reflect the user’s locale preferences throughout the application.

### Local Dev Responding With Test Message In UI (#10)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433e6e73-dd0e-4714-a514-e226375669ad)

When running locally, we have logic that checks if litellm is running by sending a single "hello" to the llm. This is a great way to be able to fall back to the bare openai api if the developer doesn't want to run litellm locally. However the problem is that this invoke to the langchain llm client happens within the task node of the langgraph workflow. Meaning that the "Hello" back from the LLM is streamed to the UI. The solution is simply to remove the callbacks array when running `client.invoke()`.
