### Introduce new API for custom field permissions (#1531)

We have introduced new routes for retrieving permissions for custom fields. This update enhances the functionality and flexibility of managing custom fields in your application.

Please note, this update does not include any breaking changes.

As this update is backend-focused, there are no frontend changes to display via screenshots or videos.

This release introduces several functional enhancements and bug fixes across the project. Here are the key changes:

- Workflow Update: The CASBIN database URI in the GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use the service alias "db" instead of "host.docker.internal".

- Admin User Management Improvements: The admin user management script now uses the Flask app context to ensure that the database and application resources are properly accessible. The logic for upserting users based on the authentication configuration has been refactored for clarity.

- RBAC and SQL Initialization Enhancements: File handling in the RBAC utilities now uses context managers to improve resource safety and error handling. The initialization function for role-based access control verifies the existence of required SQL files, logs the process, and handles exceptions by rolling back on errors.

- Custom Fields API Refactoring: The old custom fields endpoints have been removed in favor of a new namespace that consolidates custom field code testing and permissions retrieval endpoints. A new method has been added in the database group module to retrieve roles (excluding admin roles) with proper read/write permissions for a given custom field key.

- Additional Logging and Error Handling: More detailed logging has been introduced across modules to assist with troubleshooting and monitoring.

- Test Improvements: Integration tests across text editor file uploads and custom field endpoints have been updated to ensure XSS sanitization, file size validations, and proper serialization of role data. These tests also cover cases for unauthorized access and non-existent custom fields.

### Enhanced management of custom field permissions (#1423)

Version 2.0.0 introduces several updates to enhance the management of custom field permissions:

- We've added a new interface, `TCustomFieldPermissions`, to manage read/write permissions for custom fields.
- We've implemented a new API call, `GetFieldPermissions`, which fetches permissions based on field key.
- The `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook has been updated to utilize this new API for fetching permissions, simplifying the logic.
- We've adjusted imports in `API.ts` and `CustomFieldModal/index.tsx` to reflect the new model structure.

These changes result in a significant performance improvement. The field permissions dropdown now loads instantly.

Please note that these updates may introduce breaking changes.

Here are some before and after screenshots to illustrate the changes:

This update introduces enhanced functionality for managing custom field permissions, focusing on three key areas:

In the API layer (API.ts), we've added a new asynchronous function, `GetFieldPermissions`. This function fetches permissions for a custom field and returns an object with separate lists for write and read roles. We've also refactored some existing API functions for cleaner formatting.

In the `CustomFieldModal` component, we've updated the import for `CodeTestResponse` to align with the new custom fields model.

The `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook now utilizes the new `GetFieldPermissions` API function. This change replaces the previous method of manually iterating over organization roles to determine update permissions, simplifying the logic by directly setting update roles from the 'write' permissions received from the API.

We've introduced a new type, `TCustomFieldPermissions`, in the custom_fields model. This new type consolidates the structure for field permissions and ensures type consistency throughout the codebase.

Overall, these changes enhance the clarity and efficiency of permission handling for custom fields by centralizing permission-related logic in the API and reducing repetitive code in UI components.

### Settings page reorganization (#1419)

We have reorganized the settings page to improve categorization and ease of use. The settings are now divided into three main categories: General Settings, Account Settings, and Privacy Settings. This change enhances readability and provides a clearer understanding of the purpose of each setting.

Please note that this update does not introduce any breaking changes. 

For a visual comparison of the changes, please refer to the before and after screenshots or videos.

This update refactors the settings user interface for improved navigation and organization. The sidebar now categorizes links into logical sections such as "Your Account", "Workspace", "User Permissions", "Models", and "Documents". Here are the key changes:

- The "Stakeholders" link has been moved from the general workspace settings to a model-specific section and renamed as "Model Stakeholder Types" where applicable.
- Admin features like "Workflows" and "Workflow States" are now conditionally rendered and will only be displayed when certain user permissions (e.g., isAdmin and workflowsV3) are met.
- The order and grouping of links, such as "Risk Areas & Validation Guidelines", have been adjusted to provide a more intuitive navigation experience based on user roles.
- The overall component structure has been enhanced for better readability and accessibility. Some Box components have been replaced with Stack, and the Heading component is now used for titles.

The aim of these changes is to improve the maintainability, user experience, and adaptability of the settings interface based on user roles and permissions.
