### Configure finding statuses via the `API` (#1499)

You can now customize finding statuses directly from the `Settings` page.

You can now define and manage custom statuses for findings (e.g., `open`, `closed`, `deleted`).

### Export `organization` custom fields (#1448)

When you export an organization template, its custom fields are automatically included. Any organization created from that template will have those fields pre-configured.

You can now add custom fields to the `Organization` and `Inventory` models, enhancing template processing speed and efficiency.

### Set `PYTHONPATH` automatically for script execution (#1546)

You can now run scripts with the correct base path. The runner sets `PYTHONPATH` and calls each script as a module, ensuring relative imports resolve properly. If a module fails to load, the app returns a structured JSON error, displays it in the console, and logs the full message for easier troubleshooting.

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report",
    "details": {
      "error": "/Users/andres/code/backend/.venv/bin/python3: Error while finding module specification for 'workers.report_worker' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'workers')\n"
    },
    "user_response": "Please search for INTERNAL_ERROR in the documentation for troubleshooting information.",
    "status": 500
  },
  "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report"
}
```

This update enhances robustness and maintainability across the API and worker processes.

- Enhanced error handling prevents unexpected failures.
- Optimized worker management improves performance.
- Refined API endpoints ensure consistent data handling.

<!--- PR #1434: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/1434 --->
<!--- Labels: enhancement --->
### Upload `sourcemaps` to Datadog and Sentry during Docker build (#1434)

You can now upload JavaScript sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry during the `prod` Docker image build using a new `npm` command. The build process removes these sourcemaps from the final image to keep proprietary code private.

For more details, see the official guides: [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and the [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

You now get more reliable production error tracking. During a new `sourcemaps-upload` stage in the multi-stage Docker build, sourcemaps are uploaded to Datadog and Sentry. This stage runs `npm run sourcemaps-upload` (`scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh`), reads your Datadog and Sentry API keys from build secrets, verifies the required variables, and pushes the sourcemaps. The sourcemaps are then removed from the final image to prevent source code exposure. At runtime, Sentry is initialized with the current release version, allowing you to match errors to the correct build.


<!--- PR #1407: https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/1407 --->
<!--- Labels: enhancement --->
### Allow customization of finding statuses in the UI (#1407)

You can now create custom finding statuses to categorize findings as needed. Additionally, you can soft-delete obsolete statuses, and when a status is removed, its associated findings automatically reset to `Open`.

You can now use new `API` endpoints to fetch, create, update, and delete finding statuses. Each finding status includes a unique identifier, name, color, and a `Default` flag.
