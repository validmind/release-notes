### Configure finding statuses via the `API` (#1499)

Users can now customize finding statuses on the Settings page. This feature allows users to define their own status values, enhancing interaction with the platform.

This update introduces a feature for managing the status of findings, allowing organizations to define custom statuses such as open, closed, or deleted. It includes a new database table and model for finding statuses, enhancing data integrity and API interfaces for improved UI interaction.

Key changes include:

- A migration script creates a `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the `findings` table, backfilling existing findings and removing the deprecated column.

- The `Finding` model now uses a foreign key to the `FindingStatus` model, affecting serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes.

- A `FindingStatus` model is introduced with methods for managing statuses, including serialization and `mark_as_deleted`.

- New API endpoints for managing finding statuses, with validations for duplicate names and permission checks using `requires_auth`.

- Updates to routes, UI, reporting, and SQL views to use the new `FindingStatus` table.

- Changes to organization templates and platform configurations to incorporate finding statuses.

- Unit tests are adjusted to cover the new functionality for managing finding statuses.

### Export organization `custom_fields` in templates (#1448)

This update improves the exported organization template by adding previously missing custom fields. Their absence could complicate the setup process for new organizations. Now, when customers create a new organization using the template, these custom fields are automatically included, simplifying the setup process.

This update enhances custom fields and template processing in organization and inventory model management.

- The `sanitize_custom_fields` method now filters out empty fields, values marked as 'null' or 'n/a', and those starting with 'err:', ensuring only valid custom field values are included in serialized organization templates.

- Organization template serialization includes these sanitized custom fields for cleaner data.

- During organization creation, the system retrieves a user from the new organization and triggers custom field updates, ensuring default or template-specified fields are applied to related inventory models.

- Inventory model retrieval is improved by using a database filter for `cuid`, enhancing query efficiency and error handling.

- Template serialization now uses the latest version data, improving versioned template data handling.

- Minor formatting, logging, and error message consistency improvements have been made.

These changes streamline custom field handling and enhance organization and template management workflows.

### Improve `PYTHONPATH` handling for API and worker processes (#1546)

`PYTHONPATH` ensures scripts run with the application's original base path, enabling the correct loading of code dependencies, particularly for relative imports.

Error message handling has been enhanced. Errors now appear on the console and in the HTTP response, including details like error code, message, and user guidance. For internal errors, the response will have a status code of 500, and the error will be logged with a timestamp and detailed message.

Alternative import strategies can be considered if `PYTHONPATH` is not used.

This update enhances the API and worker processes for improved robustness and maintainability:

- The `Makefile` command for running the API now includes the current backend source directory in the `PYTHONPATH`, ensuring clearer module resolution and avoiding path issues.

- The UI reporting route now invokes the report worker using module syntax with the `-m` flag, simplifying command line usage and preventing path resolution issues. Error handling is improved by checking for detailed error information before logging and propagating errors.

- Import statements in the report worker file have been refactored to use direct imports from the `db` package, replacing deeply nested module paths. This change streamlines dependencies and enhances maintainability.

### Upload `sourcemaps` to `Datadog` and `Sentry` without deployment (#1434)

This update allows sourcemaps to be uploaded to Datadog and Sentry, improving debugging capabilities. An `npm` command is run during the `prod` Docker image build to enable this. Sourcemaps are not included in the final build to protect proprietary information. For more information, see the documentation for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

Note: A related update in GitHub actions is needed for new variables during the build, as detailed in https://github.com/validmind/backend/pull/1539.

This update introduces a multi-stage Docker build to streamline sourcemap uploads, enhancing error tracking and debugging in production. A new `sourcemaps-upload` build stage securely manages API keys for Datadog and Sentry using build secrets. A custom NPM script checks environment variables and uploads sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry. The production stage now removes sourcemap files to protect source details. Sentry initialization is updated to include the release version, improving data correlation.

Functional changes include:

- Adding a Docker build stage for sourcemap uploads.
- Automating sourcemap uploads via Datadog and Sentry APIs.
- Updating package scripts and adding development dependencies.
- Modifying Sentry initialization to include the release version.

### Allow users to customize finding statuses in the `UI` (#1407)

This update allows users to customize finding statuses by creating new ones and 'soft-deleting' existing ones. When a status is deleted, all associated findings will automatically revert to `Open`.

This update adds a feature for managing finding statuses in the application, including new API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting these statuses. The data model now includes a type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag.

New UI components support this feature, such as the `AddFindingStatusModal`, which uses a shared color grid selector. Default statuses have restricted name edits. The main application and settings pages now integrate these statuses, with a new sidebar link for authorized users. Existing components, like findings lists and detailed views, now display updated statuses using the `VMTag` component with colors from the status data.

Several settings pages were refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout for consistency. This update enhances both the backend (API) and frontend (components and layout) to support the new finding statuses.
