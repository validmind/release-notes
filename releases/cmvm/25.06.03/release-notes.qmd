### feat: add securityContext-related toggles (#73)

This update introduces several functional improvements focused on security hardening and deployment stability within the Helm charts and associated CI/CD workflows.

Customers are now able to enable a security context for their ValidMind deployments. By default, it will enforce the following constraints:

* Privilege escalation will not be allowed.

* The `api`, `worker` and `worker-beat` containers will run as user `vmuser` with uid `1000`. The `litellm` container will run as user `nobody` with uid `65534`. The `app` container will run as user `nginx` with uid `101`. The `redis` container will run as user `redis` with uid `999`. The `postgres` container for POC-related purposes only will run as user `postgres` with uid `999`.

* A seccomp profile may be specified, otherwise it will default to `RuntimeDefault`.

* All linux capabilities will be dropped in the interest of least-privilege. An update to add capabilities back will be added in a future update if needed.

Regardless of whether or not the `securityContext.enabled` field is `true`, the following will hold:

* The `app` pod now listens on port `8000`. The `app` service will continue to listen on `80` and proxy to `8000` on the container.

* The `api`, `app`, `worker`, `worker-beat` and `litellm` containers will run as non-root users by default.

Please upgrade to the latest CMVM version and use helm chart tag `v0.0.8` to enable this functionality.
