### Add `securityContext` toggles for improved security and stability (#73)

This update introduces several functional improvements focused on security hardening and deployment stability within the Helm charts and associated CI/CD workflows.

This update enhances your Helm charts and CI/CD workflows by introducing a security context for ValidMind deployments, improving security and stability.

By default, enabling the security context enforces these constraints:

- Privilege escalation is not allowed.
- The `api`, `worker`, and `worker-beat` containers run as user `vmuser` with `uid` `1000`.
- The `litellm` container runs as user `nobody` with `uid` `65534`.
- The `app` container runs as user `nginx` with `uid` `101`.
- The `redis` container runs as user `redis` with `uid` `999`.
- The `postgres` container, for POC purposes only, runs as user `postgres` with `uid` `999`.
- A seccomp profile can be specified, defaulting to `RuntimeDefault` if unspecified.
- All Linux capabilities are dropped to maintain a least-privilege approach, with the option to add capabilities back in the future if needed.

The following changes apply regardless of the `securityContext.enabled` setting:

- The `app` pod now listens on port `8000`, while the `app` service continues to listen on port `80` and proxies to `8000` on the container.
- The `api`, `worker`, `worker-beat`, and `litellm` containers run as non-root users with specific `uid`s.

To utilize these enhancements, upgrade to the latest CMVM version and use Helm chart tag `v0.0.8`.
