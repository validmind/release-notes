### Add `securityContext` toggles for enhanced security (#73)

This update introduces several functional improvements focused on security hardening and deployment stability within the Helm charts and associated CI/CD workflows.

This update enhances the security and stability of your ValidMind deployments by enabling a security context. By default, the following constraints are enforced:

* Privilege escalation is not allowed.

* The `api`, `worker`, and `worker-beat` containers run as user `vmuser` with UID `1000`. 
* The `litellm` container runs as user `nobody` with UID `65534`.
* The `app` container runs as user `nginx` with UID `101`.
* The `redis` container runs as user `redis` with UID `999`.
* The `postgres` container, for proof of concept purposes only, runs as user `postgres` with UID `999`.

* You can specify a seccomp profile, which defaults to `RuntimeDefault` if not set.

* All Linux capabilities are dropped for least-privilege. Future updates may allow adding capabilities back if needed.

Regardless of the `securityContext.enabled` field setting:

* The `app` pod now listens on port `8000`, while the `app` service continues to listen on port `80` and proxies to `8000` on the container.

* The `api`, `app`, `worker`, `worker-beat`, and `litellm` containers run as non-root users by default.

Please upgrade to the latest CMVM version and use Helm chart tag `v0.0.8` to enable this functionality.
