### Add new custom fields permissions API (#1531)

New routes have been added to retrieve permissions for custom fields.

This update improves workflow, user management, and API functionality while addressing several bugs. Key changes include:

- The CASBIN database URI in GitHub Actions now uses `db` as the service alias.
- Admin user management scripts utilize the Flask app context for better database access.
- RBAC utilities use context managers for safer file handling, with enhanced error logging and rollback on failure.
- The Custom Fields API has been refactored to consolidate endpoints and add a method for retrieving roles with permissions.
- Enhanced logging and error handling have been implemented across modules.
- Integration tests have been updated for XSS sanitization and file validations.

The CASBIN database URI in GitHub Actions now uses `db` instead of `host.docker.internal`.

Admin user management scripts now explicitly use the Flask app context (`with app.app_context()`) for proper database and resource access. User upsertion logic has been clarified.

RBAC utilities now use context managers (`with open(...)`) for improved resource safety and error handling. The role-based access control initialization function verifies required SQL files, logs processes, and handles exceptions with rollbacks.

Custom fields endpoints have been refactored, consolidating code into a new namespace (`ui_custom_fields.py`) and adding a method (`get_roles_for_custom_field`) to retrieve roles with read/write permissions for a given custom field key.

Enhanced logging has been added across modules to aid troubleshooting and monitoring.

Integration tests for text editor file uploads and custom field endpoints ensure XSS sanitization, file size validations, and proper serialization of role data, covering unauthorized access and non-existent custom fields.

### Reorganize settings page for improved navigation and readability (#1419)

The settings page has been reorganized to better categorize settings, enhancing readability and making it easier for users to understand the purpose of each setting.

This update enhances the settings user interface by reorganizing navigation links into logical sections, improving user experience and maintainability. The sidebar now clearly separates areas like "Your Account," "Workspace," "User Permissions," "Models," and "Documents." Key changes include moving the "Stakeholders" link to a model-specific section, introducing conditional rendering for admin features, and refining component structure for better readability and accessibility.

Key changes include:

- Moving the "Stakeholders" link from general workspace settings to a model-specific section and renaming it "Model Stakeholder Types" where applicable.

- Introducing conditional rendering for admin features like "Workflows" and "Workflow States," which are only displayed when user permissions (e.g., `isAdmin` and `workflowsV3`) are met.

- Adjusting the order and grouping of links (e.g., "Risk Areas & Validation Guidelines" remains tied to permissions) to provide a more intuitive navigation experience based on user roles.

- Enhancing the overall component structure by replacing some `Box` components with `Stack` and using the `Heading` component for titles, thereby improving readability and accessibility.

These changes aim to improve maintainability, user experience, and adaptability of the settings interface based on user roles and permissions.

### Refactor custom field permissions handling (#1423)

This update introduces the `TCustomFieldPermissions` interface for managing read and write permissions on custom fields. The new `GetFieldPermissions` API call retrieves permissions based on field keys and is now used by the `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook, streamlining its logic. Imports in `API.ts` and `CustomFieldModal/index.tsx` have been updated to align with the new model structure, resulting in the field permissions dropdown loading instantly.

- Added the `TCustomFieldPermissions` interface to manage read and write permissions for custom fields.

- Implemented the `GetFieldPermissions` API call to fetch permissions based on the field key.

- Updated the `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook to use the new API for fetching permissions, simplifying the logic.

- Adjusted imports in `API.ts` and `CustomFieldModal/index.tsx` to reflect the new model structure.

<!-- List any breaking changes -->

<!-- Add screenshots or videos showing before/after -->

This update enhances custom field permissions handling by improving three key areas. A new asynchronous function, `GetFieldPermissions`, has been added to `API.ts` to retrieve permissions for custom fields, returning separate lists for write and read roles. The `CustomFieldModal` component now correctly imports `CodeTestResponse`, aligning with the updated custom fields model. The `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook utilizes the new `GetFieldPermissions` function, simplifying logic by using API-provided write permissions. Additionally, a new type, `TCustomFieldPermissions`, has been introduced to ensure type consistency. These changes centralize permission logic in the API, improving clarity and reducing repetitive code in UI components.

- In `API.ts`, `GetFieldPermissions` retrieves custom field permissions, returning separate lists for write and read roles. Existing API functions have been refactored for cleaner formatting.

- The `CustomFieldModal` component now correctly imports `CodeTestResponse` from the appropriate module, aligning with the new custom fields model.

- The `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook now uses the `GetFieldPermissions` API function, replacing manual iteration over organization roles with direct use of API-provided write permissions.

- A new type, `TCustomFieldPermissions`, has been introduced in the `custom_fields` model to consolidate field permissions structure and ensure type consistency.
