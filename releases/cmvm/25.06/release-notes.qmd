### Add new custom fields permissions `API` (#1531)

New routes have been added to retrieve permissions for custom fields.

This PR introduces functional enhancements and bug fixes, including workflow updates, admin user management improvements, RBAC and SQL initialization enhancements, custom fields API refactoring, additional logging, and test improvements.

- **Workflow Update:** The CASBIN database URI in GitHub Actions now uses the service alias `db` instead of `host.docker.internal`.

- **Admin User Management Improvements:** The admin user management script now uses the Flask app context (`with app.app_context()`) for proper database and application resource access. User upsertion logic based on authentication configuration has been clarified.

- **RBAC and SQL Initialization Enhancements:** RBAC utilities now use context managers (`with open(...)`) for better resource safety and error handling. The initialization function checks for required SQL files, logs the process, and rolls back on errors.

- **Custom Fields API Refactoring:** The old custom fields endpoints in `ui_customfields_utils.py` have been replaced with a new namespace in `ui_custom_fields.py`. This consolidates custom field code testing and permissions retrieval. A new method, `get_roles_for_custom_field`, retrieves roles (excluding admin roles) with appropriate permissions for a given custom field key.

- **Additional Logging and Error Handling:** Enhanced logging across modules, such as in RBAC initialization and schema update functions, aids troubleshooting and monitoring.

- **Test Improvements:** Integration tests for text editor file uploads and custom field endpoints have been updated to ensure XSS sanitization, file size validations, and proper role data serialization. Tests also cover unauthorized access and non-existent custom fields.

### Reorganize settings page for improved navigation and accessibility (#1419)

The settings page has been reorganized to better categorize settings, enhancing readability and making it easier for users to understand the purpose of each setting.

This update refactors the settings user interface by reorganizing and grouping navigation links into logical sections. The sidebar now clearly distinguishes between "Your Account," "Workspace," "User Permissions," "Models," and "Documents." Key changes include moving the "Stakeholders" link to a model-specific section, conditional rendering of admin features, and improved navigation order. The component structure is enhanced for better readability and accessibility.

This PR refactors the settings user interface by reorganizing and grouping navigation links into more logical sections. The sidebar now differentiates between areas such as "Your Account," "Workspace," "User Permissions," "Models," and "Documents." Key changes include:

- Moving the "Stakeholders" link from the general workspace settings to a model-specific section and renaming it "Model Stakeholder Types" where applicable.

- Introducing conditional rendering for admin features such as "Workflows" and "Workflow States," which are only displayed when user permissions (e.g., `isAdmin` and `workflowsV3`) are met.

- Adjusting the order and grouping of links to provide a more intuitive navigation experience based on user roles.

- Enhancing the overall component structure by replacing some `Box` components with `Stack` and using the `Heading` component for titles, thereby improving readability and accessibility.

These changes aim to improve maintainability, user experience, and adaptability of the settings interface based on user roles and permissions.

### Refactor custom field permissions handling (#1423)

The update introduces the `TCustomFieldPermissions` interface for managing custom field permissions, allowing for both read and write access. A new `GetFieldPermissions` API call has been implemented to retrieve permissions using a field key. The `useCustomFieldPermissions` hook now utilizes this API, streamlining its logic. Additionally, imports in `API.ts` and `CustomFieldModal/index.tsx` have been adjusted to align with the new model structure. This enhancement ensures the field permissions dropdown loads instantly. ðŸ«¡

<!-- List any breaking changes -->

<!-- Add screenshots or videos showing before/after -->

This update improves custom field permission handling by centralizing logic and reducing repetitive code. Key changes include:

- Added an asynchronous function `GetFieldPermissions` in `API.ts` to retrieve custom field permissions, returning separate lists for write and read roles.
- Updated `CustomFieldModal` to import `CodeTestResponse` correctly.
- Refactored `useCustomFieldPermissions` to use `GetFieldPermissions`, simplifying permission logic.
- Introduced `TCustomFieldPermissions` type for consistent permission structure across the codebase. 

These enhancements streamline permission management for custom fields.
