This update enhances security and deployment stability in Helm charts.

You can now enable a security context for ValidMind deployments to:

- Block privilege escalation
- Drop all Linux capabilities
- Apply the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile

All containers now run as non-root:

- `api`, `worker`, `worker-beat`: `vmuser` (uid `1000`)
- `litellm`: `nobody` (uid `65534`)
- `app`: `nginx` (uid `101`)
- `redis`: `redis` (uid `999`)
- `postgres` (POC only): `postgres` (uid `999`)

The `app` pod now listens on port `8000`, while the service still exposes port `80` and forwards traffic accordingly.

Upgrade to the latest CMVM release and use helm chart tag `v0.0.8` to enable these features.
