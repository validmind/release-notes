This update enhances security and deployment stability in the Helm charts.

You can now enable a pod security context (Helm chart tag `v0.0.8`) that blocks privilege escalation, applies the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile, drops all Linux capabilities, and runs each container as a non-root user:

- `api`, `worker`, `worker-beat`: `vmuser` (uid 1000)
- `litellm`: `nobody` (uid 65534)
- `app`: `nginx` (uid 101)
- `redis`: `redis` (uid 999)
- `postgres` (POC only): `postgres` (uid 999)

Other updates:

- `app` listens on port 8000; the service still exposes port 80 and proxies to 8000.
- `postgres` no longer mounts an `emptyDir` volume.
- RDB snapshotting is disabled for `redis`.
- The `cmvm-test` namespace adopts the new restricted policy.
- Liveness and readiness probe timeouts for `litellm` are increased to accommodate slower non-root startup.
