This update enhances the security and stability of your ValidMind deployments by enabling a security context. By default, the following constraints are enforced:

* Privilege escalation is not allowed.

* The `api`, `worker`, and `worker-beat` containers run as user `vmuser` with UID `1000`. 
* The `litellm` container runs as user `nobody` with UID `65534`.
* The `app` container runs as user `nginx` with UID `101`.
* The `redis` container runs as user `redis` with UID `999`.
* The `postgres` container, for proof of concept purposes only, runs as user `postgres` with UID `999`.

* You can specify a seccomp profile, which defaults to `RuntimeDefault` if not set.

* All Linux capabilities are dropped for least-privilege. Future updates may allow adding capabilities back if needed.

Regardless of the `securityContext.enabled` field setting:

* The `app` pod now listens on port `8000`, while the `app` service continues to listen on port `80` and proxies to `8000` on the container.

* The `api`, `app`, `worker`, `worker-beat`, and `litellm` containers run as non-root users by default.

Please upgrade to the latest CMVM version and use Helm chart tag `v0.0.8` to enable this functionality.

<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include references to CI/CD workflows that need removal, some duplication between the PR summary and external notes, and verbose language that could be streamlined for clarity. The external notes provide detailed information that should be prioritized over the PR summary.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Remove the reference to 'CI/CD workflows' in the PR summary as it pertains to internal processes.
2. Ensure that the remaining content in the PR summary is concise and aligns with the external notes.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Merge the PR summary's remaining content with the external notes, ensuring that the external notes' detailed context is preserved and prioritized.
2. Remove any redundant introductory statements from the PR summary that overlap with the external notes.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Simplify verbose language in the external notes for clarity. For example, rephrase "Customers are now able to enable a security context for their ValidMind deployments" to "You can now enable a security context for your ValidMind deployments."
2. Break up overly long sentences for improved readability. For instance, separate the detailed list of container user IDs into individual, clearer statements if needed.
3. Ensure that the language is direct and uses 'you' instead of 'customers' or 'users' to maintain a consistent tone.
