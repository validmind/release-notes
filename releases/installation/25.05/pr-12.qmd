# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It removes the informal "feat:" prefix, which is typically used in commit messages, and presents the information in a straightforward manner. The use of backticks around "helm" is a nice touch, as it indicates that it is a specific term or command, which can be helpful for clarity. Overall, the edited content effectively communicates the intended updates without unnecessary jargon.
