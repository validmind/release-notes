# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content improves the original by capitalizing the first word, which is standard for titles or headings, and by enclosing "helm" in backticks, which is a common practice to denote code or command-line tools. This makes the content clearer and more professional. Overall, the edit enhances readability and aligns with technical writing conventions.
