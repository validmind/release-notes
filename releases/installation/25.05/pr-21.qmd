# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content improves the original by capitalizing the first word, which is standard for titles or headings. Additionally, it uses backticks to format `onePasswordItem` as inline code, which is appropriate for a template name, making it stand out and indicating that it is a specific code element. Overall, the edit enhances clarity and readability.
