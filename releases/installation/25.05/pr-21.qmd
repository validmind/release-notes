# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content improves the original by capitalizing the first word, which is a standard practice for titles or headings. Additionally, it uses backticks around `onePasswordItem`, which is a common convention to denote code or specific terms, making it clearer that it refers to a template or code element. Overall, the edited content is more polished and adheres to common formatting standards.
