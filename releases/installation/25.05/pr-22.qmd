# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content provides a clearer and more direct description of the task. By changing "Readme cleanup" to "Clean up `readme` file," it specifies the action to be taken and the target file, making it more understandable. The use of backticks around "readme" is a nice touch, as it indicates that "readme" is a file or code element, which is a common convention in technical documentation. Overall, the edit improves clarity and precision.
