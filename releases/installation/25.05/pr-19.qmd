# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It capitalizes "Toggle" to start the sentence properly and uses backticks around "keycloak" to indicate it is a code or technical term, which enhances readability and understanding. The word "fix:" is removed, which is appropriate if it was not necessary for the context. Overall, the edited content effectively communicates the intended action in a more polished manner.

This will fix some CreateContainerConfigErrors when using the merged helm chart when keycloak is disabled.
