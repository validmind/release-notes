The instructions for customer-managed ValidMind now include the full installation process, covering authentication methods like Keycloak, OIDC, and Entra:

1. Preparing your environment
2. Pulling the container images
3. Pulling the Helm chart
4. Configuring your Helm chart
5. Configuring LiteLLM
6. Installing via Helm chart
7. Completing the initial setup

These updates improve usability with better organization and visual aids. The new structure separates deployment and administration sections, enhances navigation, and includes callout boxes and process diagrams.
