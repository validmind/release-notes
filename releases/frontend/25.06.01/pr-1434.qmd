This update enhances sourcemap management:

- An `npm` command uploads sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry for debugging during the `prod` Docker image build.
- Sourcemaps are removed from the final build to protect proprietary information.

For more details, see the documentation for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

Note: GitHub Actions have been updated to include new variables needed during the build process.

The update introduces a multi-stage Docker build process to manage sourcemap uploads, enhancing error tracking and debugging. A new `sourcemaps-upload` build stage securely handles API keys for Datadog and Sentry using build secrets. This stage uses a custom NPM script (`sourcemaps-upload`) defined in the package configuration and executed via the `scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh` file. The script checks for necessary environment variables and conditionally uploads sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry.

Key changes include:

- A Docker build stage for sourcemap uploads.
- Integration with Datadog and Sentry APIs for automated uploads.
- Updates to package scripts and addition of necessary development dependencies.
- Modifications to Sentry initialization in the frontend application to include the current release version, aiding in correlating sourcemap data with application versions.

The production stage now copies the build output from the sourcemaps upload stage and removes sourcemap files from the final container to prevent exposure of source details.
