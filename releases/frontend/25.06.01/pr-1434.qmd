#### What and why?
This PR does a few things:
- Add npm command to upload the sourcemaps to Datadog & Sentry for debugging help
- Run the sourcemaps upload command during `prod` docker image build
- `rm` the sourcemaps from the final build target to avoid exposing proprietary information

See the docs for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/) for details.

#### Dependencies, breaking changes, and deployment notes
https://github.com/validmind/backend/pull/1539 updates the github actions for the new variables needed during build.

#### External Release Notes
- Adds the ability to upload sourcemaps to datadog and/or sentry

# PR Summary
This pull request introduces a new multi-stage Docker build to handle the uploading of sourcemaps for enhanced error tracking and debugging in production. A dedicated build stage named `sourcemaps-upload` is added which leverages build secrets to securely handle API keys for Datadog and Sentry. The new stage uses a custom NPM script (`sourcemaps-upload`) defined in the package configuration and implemented in the `scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh` file. This script checks for the presence of required environment variables and conditionally uploads the sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry. Additionally, the production stage now copies the build output from the sourcemaps upload stage and removes sourcemap files from the final container to prevent exposure of source details. Finally, the initialization of Sentry in the frontend application is updated to include the current release version, which should help in correlating sourcemap data with application versions.

Functional changes include:
- Introducing a new Docker build stage for uploading sourcemaps.
- Integrating Datadog and Sentry APIs for automated sourcemap uploads.
- Updating package scripts and adding necessary dev dependencies.
- Modifying Sentry initialization in the application to include the release version.
