`GitHub Actions` accepts the required build variables, allowing you to upload `sourcemaps` to `Datadog` or `Sentry` for improved error tracking.

This update introduces a `sourcemaps-upload` stage to the multi-stage Docker build. This stage executes the `sourcemaps-upload` NPM script through `scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh`, utilizing build secrets for Datadog and Sentry API keys. It validates necessary environment variables and uploads sourcemaps to both services. In the production stage, the build output is copied, and sourcemap files are deleted to prevent source exposure. Sentry initializes with the current release version to ensure errors align with the uploaded sourcemaps.
