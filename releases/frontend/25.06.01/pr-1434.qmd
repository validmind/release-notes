You can now upload JavaScript sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry during the `prod` Docker image build using a new `npm` command. The build process removes these sourcemaps from the final image to keep proprietary code private.

For more details, see the official guides: [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and the [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

You now get more reliable production error tracking. During a new `sourcemaps-upload` stage in the multi-stage Docker build, sourcemaps are uploaded to Datadog and Sentry. This stage runs `npm run sourcemaps-upload` (`scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh`), reads your Datadog and Sentry API keys from build secrets, verifies the required variables, and pushes the sourcemaps. The sourcemaps are then removed from the final image to prevent source code exposure. At runtime, Sentry is initialized with the current release version, allowing you to match errors to the correct build.
