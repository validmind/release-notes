This update enhances debugging by incorporating an `npm` command to upload sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry during the `prod` Docker image build. Sourcemaps are removed from the final build to protect proprietary information. For more details, refer to the documentation for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/). A related GitHub Actions update is required for new build variables, as detailed in https://github.com/validmind/backend/pull/1539.

- Adds the ability to upload sourcemaps to Datadog and/or Sentry.

This update introduces a multi-stage Docker build to enhance error tracking and debugging in production by managing sourcemap uploads. A new build stage, `sourcemaps-upload`, securely handles API keys for Datadog and Sentry using build secrets. A custom NPM script, `sourcemaps-upload`, checks environment variables and uploads sourcemaps. The production stage now copies build output from this stage and removes sourcemap files to protect source details. Sentry initialization is updated to include the release version.

Functional changes include:

- A new Docker build stage for sourcemap uploads.
- Automated sourcemap uploads via Datadog and Sentry APIs.
- Updated package scripts and added development dependencies.
- Sentry initialization now includes the release version.
