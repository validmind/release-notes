This update allows sourcemaps to be uploaded to Datadog and Sentry, improving debugging capabilities. An `npm` command is run during the `prod` Docker image build to enable this. Sourcemaps are not included in the final build to protect proprietary information. For more information, see the documentation for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

Note: A related update in GitHub actions is needed for new variables during the build, as detailed in https://github.com/validmind/backend/pull/1539.

This update introduces a multi-stage Docker build to streamline sourcemap uploads, enhancing error tracking and debugging in production. A new `sourcemaps-upload` build stage securely manages API keys for Datadog and Sentry using build secrets. A custom NPM script checks environment variables and uploads sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry. The production stage now removes sourcemap files to protect source details. Sentry initialization is updated to include the release version, improving data correlation.

Functional changes include:

- Adding a Docker build stage for sourcemap uploads.
- Automating sourcemap uploads via Datadog and Sentry APIs.
- Updating package scripts and adding development dependencies.
- Modifying Sentry initialization to include the release version.
