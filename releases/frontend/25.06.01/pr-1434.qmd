You can now upload JavaScript sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry using a new `npm` script that runs automatically during the production Docker build. The updated GitHub Actions workflow provides the necessary variables and then removes the sourcemaps from the final image to protect proprietary code.

The Dockerfile now includes a `sourcemaps-upload` stage that runs `scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh`. This script uses build secrets for Datadog and Sentry API keys, validates necessary environment variables, uploads generated sourcemaps to both services, and transfers the compiled output to the production stage. Sourcemap files are deleted from the final image to protect source code.

Frontend Sentry initialization now includes the current release version, ensuring uploaded sourcemaps align with production errors.
