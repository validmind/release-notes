This update allows you to upload sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry, improving debugging capabilities. An `npm` command is provided for this upload and runs during the `prod` Docker image build. Sourcemaps are removed from the final build target to protect proprietary information. For more details, see the documentation for [Datadog sourcemap](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/upload-javascript-source-maps/), [Sentry sourcemap](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/), and [Sentry release](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/).

Note: The related GitHub actions have been updated to include new variables needed during the build process.

This update introduces a multi-stage Docker build to improve error tracking and debugging in production by managing the uploading of sourcemaps. A dedicated build stage, `sourcemaps-upload`, is added, using build secrets to securely handle API keys for Datadog and Sentry. This stage uses a custom NPM script (`sourcemaps-upload`) defined in the package configuration and implemented in the `scripts/sourcemaps-upload.sh` file. The script checks for required environment variables and conditionally uploads the sourcemaps to Datadog and Sentry. The production stage now copies the build output from the sourcemaps upload stage and removes sourcemap files from the final container to prevent exposure of source details. Sentry initialization in the frontend application is updated to include the current release version, aiding in correlating sourcemap data with application versions.

Functional changes include:

- Introducing a Docker build stage for uploading sourcemaps.
- Integrating Datadog and Sentry APIs for automated sourcemap uploads.
- Updating package scripts and adding necessary development dependencies.
- Modifying Sentry initialization to include the release version.
