You can now customize finding statuses by creating new ones and 'soft-deleting' existing ones. If a finding status is deleted, all findings using that status will default to `Open`.

This update introduces a feature for managing finding statuses within the application. It adds new API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses. The data model now includes a type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag. New UI components support this functionality, including a modal (`AddFindingStatusModal`) with a shared color grid selector for choosing color schemes. The modal disables edits on default status names. The main application and settings pages integrate the new finding statuses, adding a sidebar link for you if you have the appropriate permissions. Existing components that display finding statuses, such as findings lists and detailed views, now use these new statuses and display them with the updated design, using a `VMTag` component with colors derived from the status data. Several settings pages were refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout for a consistent look and feel. This update integrates the new finding statuses feature on the backend through API enhancements and on the frontend through component and layout updates.
