This update enables users to customize finding statuses by:

- Creating new finding statuses.
- Soft-deleting existing finding statuses.
- Defaulting all findings to `Open` if their status is deleted.

This update introduces a feature for managing finding statuses, including new API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting these statuses. The data model now includes a new type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag.

New UI components, such as the `AddFindingStatusModal`, support this functionality. The modal uses a shared color grid selector for color schemes and manages default statuses by disabling name edits. The main application and settings pages have been updated to integrate the new finding statuses, with a new sidebar link for users with the appropriate permissions. Existing components, like findings lists and detailed views, now use these new statuses and display them with the updated design, such as the `VMTag` component with colors from the status data.

Several settings pages were refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application. This update integrates the new finding statuses feature on both the backend (via API enhancements) and the frontend (via component and layout updates).
