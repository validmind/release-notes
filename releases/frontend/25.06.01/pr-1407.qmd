You can now create custom finding statuses and `soft-delete` them. Deleting a status automatically resets associated findings to `Open`.

You can now manage finding statuses using new API endpoints: `fetch`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`. The expanded data model includes an ID, name, color scheme, and default flag.

The UI introduces `AddFindingStatusModal` with a shared color grid. Names of default statuses are read-only. Findings lists, detail views, and settings pages display statuses using `VMTag`. A sidebar link is available for roles with permission. All affected settings pages use the unified `SettingsSection` layout.
