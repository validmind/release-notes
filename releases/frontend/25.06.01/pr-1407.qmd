Users can now create custom finding statuses and soft-delete existing ones. When a status is deleted, all associated findings revert to `Open`.

This update adds a feature for managing finding statuses, including API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting these statuses. The data model now includes a type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag.

New UI components support this functionality, such as a modal (`AddFindingStatusModal`) with a shared color grid selector for choosing color schemes. The modal manages default statuses by disabling edits on their names. The main application and settings pages now integrate the new finding statuses, with a sidebar link for users with appropriate permissions. Existing components that display finding statuses now use these new statuses and display them with the updated design, employing a `VMTag` component with colors derived from the status data.

Several settings pages have been refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.
