Users can now customize finding statuses by creating new ones and deleting existing ones. When a status is deleted, associated findings will revert to `Open`.

This update introduces a feature for managing finding statuses, including API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting them. The data model now includes a type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag.

New UI components support this functionality, such as a modal (`AddFindingStatusModal`) with a shared color grid selector for choosing color schemes. The modal manages default statuses by disabling edits on their names. The main application and settings pages now integrate the new finding statuses, with a new sidebar link for users with appropriate permissions. Existing components that display finding statuses now use these new statuses and display them using the updated design, utilizing a `VMTag` component with colors derived from the status data.

Several settings pages were refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.
