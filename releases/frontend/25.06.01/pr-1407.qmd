You can now customize finding statuses by creating new ones or soft-deleting existing ones. When a status is deleted, any findings assigned to it automatically revert to `Open`.

You can now manage finding statuses. New API endpoints allow you to fetch, create, update, and delete each status, which includes an ID, name, color scheme, and default flag. The UI introduces an `AddFindingStatusModal` with a color grid selector and restricts name edits for default statuses. Findings lists and detail views display statuses using `VMTag` with their assigned colors. Settings pages now use a unified `SettingsSection` layout and feature a permission-gated sidebar link for managing finding statuses.
