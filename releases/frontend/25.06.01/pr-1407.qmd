You can now create custom finding statuses to categorize findings as needed. Additionally, you can soft-delete obsolete statuses, and when a status is removed, its associated findings automatically reset to `Open`.

You can now use new `API` endpoints to fetch, create, update, and delete finding statuses. Each finding status includes a unique identifier, name, color, and a `Default` flag.
