This update allows users to customize finding statuses by creating new ones and 'soft-deleting' existing ones. When a status is deleted, all associated findings will automatically revert to `Open`.

This update adds a feature for managing finding statuses in the application, including new API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting these statuses. The data model now includes a type for finding status with a unique identifier, color scheme, name, and default flag.

New UI components support this feature, such as the `AddFindingStatusModal`, which uses a shared color grid selector. Default statuses have restricted name edits. The main application and settings pages now integrate these statuses, with a new sidebar link for authorized users. Existing components, like findings lists and detailed views, now display updated statuses using the `VMTag` component with colors from the status data.

Several settings pages were refactored to use a new `SettingsSection` layout for consistency. This update enhances both the backend (API) and frontend (components and layout) to support the new finding statuses.
