# PR Summary

This PR introduces a new feature for managing finding statuses within the application. It adds a set of new API endpoints for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses. The data model is expanded by introducing a new type for finding status that includes a unique identifier, a color scheme, a name, and a default flag. 

New UI components were implemented to support this functionality. A dedicated modal (AddFindingStatusModal) was built that leverages a shared color grid selector for choosing color schemes. The modal carefully handles default statuses by disabling edits on their names. The main application and various settings pages have been updated to integrate the new finding statuses, including adding a new sidebar link for users with the appropriate permissions. In addition, existing components that display finding statuses (such as in findings lists and detailed views) now use these new statuses and display them using the updated design (e.g., using a VMTag component with colors dynamically derived from the status data).

Furthermore, several settings pages were refactored to consistently use a new SettingsSection layout, ensuring a uniform look and feel across the application. Overall, the PR integrates the new finding statuses feature both on the backend (via API enhancements) and the frontend (via component and layout updates).
