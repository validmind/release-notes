This update introduces cookie-based authentication as an alternative to authorization headers for accessing assets. Previously, assets embedded in HTML were inaccessible due to the inability to set an `Authorization` header. Now, the system first attempts to authenticate with the `Authorization` header and, if unsuccessful, uses the `authToken` cookie. This change enhances security by ensuring only authorized users can access organization-specific assets.

The update addresses the issue where authenticated users could not view assets embedded in HTML documentation, reports, and other UI components due to the inability to set an auth header. Cookie-based authentication offers a secure alternative for these scenarios. It also resolves a security issue where unauthorized users could potentially access assets from organizations they do not belong to.

This change is part of a broader security enhancement to prevent unauthorized access to organization-specific assets. The backend changes include organization-level access control validation to ensure users can only access assets from their own organization.

This pull request enhances the `MainApp` component and related modules by introducing a new feature that sets an authentication token as a cookie when an access token is available. This allows asset requests to authenticate users via the cookie. Additionally, `onSuccess` and event handler callbacks have been refactored for improved readability by consistently wrapping arrow function parameters in parentheses. Minor code formatting adjustments have been made to standardize styling in role and permission mappings and JSX routing components. The primary functional update is the addition of the auth token as a cookie.
