This update introduces key enhancements and bug fixes, focusing on UI updates, API improvements, and new features:

- UI components now use theme defaults for spinner colors, ensuring consistent styling.
- The `GetWorkflows` API supports pagination and filtering by trigger type. A new `GetWorkflowDependencies` API retrieves model dependency counts and dependent workflows.
- The workflow deletion modal shows dependency warnings and disables the delete button if dependencies exist.
- A new run workflow node allows users to trigger workflows via a dropdown.
- UI tweaks and debugging enhancements improve node components and contextual data display.

UI components across the application have been updated to remove hardcoded spinner colors, now relying on theme defaults for consistent styling.

The `GetWorkflows` API function now supports pagination and optional filtering by trigger type. A new `GetWorkflowDependencies` API retrieves model dependency counts and lists workflows dependent on a given workflow, aiding in deletion decisions.

The workflow deletion modal now handles dependency errors gracefully. If a workflow cannot be deleted due to dependencies, a warning is displayed with a list of dependent workflows, and the delete button is disabled.

A new run workflow node and its panel allow users to trigger workflows via a dropdown, integrated into the workflow canvas. It supports configuration with the `useWorkflows` hook for paginated workflow options.

Several node components have received minor UI tweaks and added inline inspection popovers for debugging. Components like `NodeBox` now display contextual data to assist in troubleshooting workflows.
