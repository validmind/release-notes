A new "Run Workflow" step has been introduced, enabling users to target and execute any manually triggered workflow.

The styling for workflow node boxes has been updated for consistent coloring, outline, and selection. These changes affect both zoom-in and zoom-out views of configured and unconfigured node boxes.

This update introduces key enhancements and bug fixes:

- **UI & Spinner Update**: Spinners now use theme defaults for consistent styling, removing hardcoded color properties.

- **Workflow API Enhancements**: The `GetWorkflows` function now supports pagination and filtering by trigger type. A new `GetWorkflowDependencies` function retrieves model dependency counts and lists dependent workflows to aid in deletion decisions.

- **Workflow Deletion Modal Improvements**: The delete modal now shows a warning alert with dependent workflows if deletion is blocked by dependencies, and disables the delete button.

- **New Run Workflow Feature**: A new node allows users to trigger another workflow, integrated into the workflow canvas with a configurable dropdown for workflow options.

- **UI Consistency & Debug Enhancements**: Minor UI tweaks and inline inspection popovers aid debugging. Components like `NodeBox` now display contextual data for troubleshooting workflows.
