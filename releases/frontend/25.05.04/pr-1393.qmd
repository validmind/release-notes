A new "Run Workflow" step has been introduced, enabling users to target and execute any manually triggered workflow.

The styling of workflow node boxes has been updated for consistent coloring, outline, and selection. These updates are applicable to both zoom-in and zoom-out views of configured and unconfigured node boxes.

For more details, refer to the related changes in the ValidMind backend repository.

This PR introduces key enhancements and bug fixes, improving UI consistency, API functionality, and workflow management. Spinners now use theme defaults for consistent styling. The `GetWorkflows` API supports pagination and filtering, and a new `GetWorkflowDependencies` function aids in workflow deletion decisions. The workflow deletion modal now handles dependency errors more gracefully. A new run workflow node allows triggering other workflows, and UI tweaks enhance debugging and node component styling.

- UI & Spinner Update: Spinners across the application now use theme defaults for consistent styling.

- Workflow API Enhancements: The `GetWorkflows` function supports pagination and filtering by trigger type. The new `GetWorkflowDependencies` function retrieves model dependency counts and lists dependent workflows, aiding deletion decisions.

- Workflow Deletion Modal Improvements: The delete modal now shows warnings and lists dependent workflows if deletion is blocked by dependencies, disabling the delete button.

- New Run Workflow Feature: A new node allows users to trigger other workflows, integrated into the workflow canvas with UI components and an inline dropdown for workflow selection.

- UI Consistency & Debug Enhancements: Minor UI tweaks and added inline inspection popovers aid debugging. Components like `NodeBox` now display contextual data for troubleshooting workflows.
