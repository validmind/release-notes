The documentation sections will no longer include default text blocks. Instead, an empty state will prompt users to "Add New Block."

Fixed a bug where some sections were not being deleted.

This update refactors the menu rendering logic in the `BlockExplorer` component to enhance flexibility and reusability. Key changes include:

- Introduction of a `MenuWrapper` component that consolidates menu display logic with `DocumentBlockModal` configuration, reducing duplication within the `BlockExplorer` component.

- Addition of an optional `customRender` property to `BlockExplorerProps`. When provided, `BlockExplorer` uses this method within the `MenuWrapper` for customized UI behavior, such as an empty state display with an "Add New Block" button.

- Updates in `DocumentationPage` to utilize the new `customRender` feature of `BlockExplorer`, offering a cleaner and more context-sensitive empty state. Users are prompted to start building the section, and the `MenuButton` triggers focus via the `setIsFocused` callback.

- Minor behavior changes, such as modifying the `getInitialSectionContents` function to return an empty array instead of a default content block, ensuring empty sections remain empty when appropriate.

These changes aim to improve modularity, reduce duplication, and give developers more control over block and menu rendering within the application.
