Documentation sections will no longer have default text blocks. Instead, users will see an empty state with a prompt to "Add New Block."

- Fixed a bug that prevented some sections from being deleted.

This update refactors the menu rendering logic in the `BlockExplorer` component for enhanced flexibility and reusability. Key changes include:

- A new `MenuWrapper` component consolidates menu display logic with `DocumentBlockModal` configuration, reducing duplication across the `BlockExplorer` component.
  
- An optional `customRender` property is added to `BlockExplorerProps`. When used, `BlockExplorer` renders with the `customRender` method within the `MenuWrapper`, allowing for customized UI behavior, such as an empty state display with an "Add New Block" button.

- `DocumentationPage` now uses the `customRender` feature of `BlockExplorer`, offering a cleaner, context-sensitive empty state that prompts users to start building the section. The `MenuButton` triggers focus via the `setIsFocused` callback.

- The `getInitialSectionContents` function now returns an empty array instead of a default content block, ensuring sections are truly empty when needed.

These changes improve modularity, reduce duplication, and give developers more control over block and menu rendering within the application.
