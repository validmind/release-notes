We have introduced a feature to export comments from validation reports, in addition to flags. By default, this feature is disabled. Users can enable it by selecting a new checkbox in the UI, which allows comments to be included in the report's appendix. This update includes a backend change to ensure comments are properly exported when the option is selected.

This update improves the report download feature by adding an `includeComments` option. The `DownloadReport` function now accepts an optional boolean parameter to include comments in the report data. The front-end component features a checkbox for users to toggle this option. The UI is updated to handle this new state, and the API call is adjusted to pass the `include_comments` parameter, ensuring comments are included in the report when specified.
