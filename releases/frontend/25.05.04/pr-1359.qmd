We would like the ability for comments to also be exported from validation reports. Same as the existing flags, exporting comments defaults to off.

# PR Summary

This PR enhances the report download functionality by introducing a new option, `includeComments`. On the API side (in API.ts), the `DownloadReport` function now accepts an optional boolean parameter that, when enabled, requests comments to be included in the report data. Correspondingly, the front-end component (DownloadValidationReportModal) now includes a checkbox for users to toggle this option. The UI is updated to manage this new state, and the API call is modified to pass the `include_comments` parameter, ensuring that the requested report includes comments when specified.
