We have added the ability to export comments from validation reports. Previously, only flags could be exported. By default, exporting comments is turned off. To enable this feature, a new checkbox has been added to the UI, allowing users to instruct the backend to include comments in the validation report. When exporting, comments will be included in the appendix of the document.

The screenshot shows the new "Include comments left on document" checkbox in the UI.

This update improves the report download feature by introducing the `includeComments` option. The `DownloadReport` function in `API.ts` now accepts an optional boolean parameter to include comments in the report data. The `DownloadValidationReportModal` component includes a checkbox for users to toggle this option. The UI has been updated to handle this new state, and the API call now passes the `include_comments` parameter to include comments in the report when selected.
