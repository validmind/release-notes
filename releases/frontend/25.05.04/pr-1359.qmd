We have introduced the option to export comments from validation reports. Previously, only flags could be exported. By default, exporting comments is disabled. This update adds a new checkbox in the UI, enabling users to include comments in the validation report. When selected, comments will be included in the appendix of the exported document.

This update enhances the report download feature by introducing an `includeComments` option. The `DownloadReport` function in `API.ts` now accepts an optional boolean parameter to include comments in the report data. On the front end, the `DownloadValidationReportModal` component includes a checkbox for users to toggle this option. The user interface is updated to manage this new state, and the API call is adjusted to pass the `include_comments` parameter, ensuring comments are included when specified.
