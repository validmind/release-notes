Workflow approval step voter notes have been added to the activity log.

This PR introduces several UI enhancements and refactors to improve functionality and user experience. Key changes include collapsible content in the `EventRowLayout` component for displaying additional details like vote notes, with an `IconButton` to toggle visibility. New components for workflow approvals have been added, such as `ApprovalActionButtons`, `ApprovalHeader`, `ApprovalVoterCard`, `VoteDetailsModal`, and `VoterStatusColumn`, enhancing usability and organization. Redundant code has been cleaned up, increasing modularity and maintainability.

The `EventRowLayout` component now features collapsible content to show extra details, such as vote notes, when available. An `IconButton` toggles a `Collapse` element, with the icon switching between a downward and upward chevron.

New workflow approval components include:

- `ApprovalActionButtons`: A button group for approving or rejecting votes with appropriate colors and icons.
- `ApprovalHeader`: Displays the approval title and message in a structured layout.
- `ApprovalVoterCard`: Shows voter information with an optional popover for vote notes.
- `VoteDetailsModal`: A modal for viewing vote notes in a read-only textarea.
- `VoterStatusColumn` and constants: Organizes and displays voter statuses in columns with a consistent look.

Redundant code and inline comments have been replaced with reusable components, enhancing maintainability and readability. Overall, this PR improves code modularity and provides a more interactive UI for event and workflow approvals.
