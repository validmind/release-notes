Workflow approval step voter notes have been added to the activity log.

This update introduces UI enhancements and code refactoring to improve user interaction and maintainability. The `EventRowLayout` component now includes collapsible content for additional details like vote notes, toggled by an `IconButton`. New components for workflow approvals include `ApprovalActionButtons`, `ApprovalHeader`, `ApprovalVoterCard`, `VoteDetailsModal`, and `VoterStatusColumn`, each enhancing usability and consistency. Redundant code has been streamlined, increasing modularity and interactivity in event and workflow approval processes.

In the `EventRowLayout` component, collapsible content has been implemented to display additional details, such as vote notes, when available. An `IconButton` toggles a `Collapse` element, with the display icon switching between a downward and upward chevron accordingly.

New components related to workflow approvals have been added:

- `ApprovalActionButtons`: Provides a consistent button group for approving or rejecting votes with appropriate color schemes and iconography.
- `ApprovalHeader`: Displays the approval title and message in a more structured layout.
- `ApprovalVoterCard`: Renders voter information with an optional popover for vote notes, enhancing usability when notes are present.
- `VoteDetailsModal`: Offers a modal for detailed viewing of vote notes in a read-only textarea.
- `VoterStatusColumn` and associated constants: These aid in organizing and displaying voter statuses in columns based on their vote state, using a uniform look for all statuses.

Some redundant code and inline commented sections have been cleaned up and replaced with reusable components, improving overall maintainability and readability.

Overall, these changes increase the modularity of the code and offer a richer, more interactive user interface for event and workflow approval processes.
