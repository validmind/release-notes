#### External Release Notes
"Added workflow approval step voter notes to the activity log"

# PR Summary

This PR introduces several functional UI enhancements and refactors across the application. The key changes include:

1. In the EventRowLayout component, collapsible content has been implemented to display additional details (such as vote notes) when available. An IconButton toggles a Collapse element, and the display icon switches between a downward and upward chevron accordingly.

2. New components related to workflow approvals have been added:
   - ApprovalActionButtons: Provides a consistent button group for approving or rejecting votes with appropriate color schemes and iconography.
   - ApprovalHeader: Displays the approval title and message in a more structured layout.
   - ApprovalVoterCard: Renders voter information with an optional popover for vote notes, enhancing usability when notes are present.
   - VoteDetailsModal: Offers a modal for detailed viewing of vote notes in a read-only textarea.
   - VoterStatusColumn and associated constants: These aid in organizing and displaying voter statuses in columns based on their vote state, using a uniform look for all statuses.

3. Some redundant code and inline commented sections have been cleaned up and replaced with reusable components, improving overall maintainability and readability.

Overall, the PR increases the modularity of the code and offers a richer, more interactive user interface for event and workflow approval processes.
