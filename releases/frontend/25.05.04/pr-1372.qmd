This update introduces delete buttons with confirmation prompts on both the list and detail pages for roles and stakeholder types. The roles detail page is adapted for stakeholder types with minor differences. Group deletion now uses a reusable component with improved styling. An `API.ts` call has been implemented for deleting roles, also applicable to stakeholder type deletions. Additionally, a stakeholder type settings menu item has been added, aligning with the [documentation](https://docs.validmind.com/guide/configuration/manage-model-stakeholder-types.html).

- Added delete buttons and confirmation prompts to the list and detail pages for roles and stakeholder types. The roles details page is reused for the stakeholder type detail page with slight differences.

- Updated group deletion to use a reusable component and improved styling for consistency.

- Implemented an `API.ts` call for deleting roles, which is also used for stakeholder type deletion requests.

- Added the stakeholder type settings menu item as per the [documentation](https://docs.validmind.com/guide/configuration/manage-model-stakeholder-types.html).

This update enhances role deletion and confirmation dialogs, improving user experience and consistency across the application.

- A new `DeleteRole` API method supports role deletion via an Axios DELETE endpoint.
  
- The `DeleteConfirmationAlert` component standardizes the deletion confirmation process across pages like Group, RoleDetails, Roles, and Stakeholders, offering consistent user experience and custom messages.

- Components such as `DangerMenuItem` have updated styling to clearly indicate destructive actions.

- The RoleDetails page now integrates the new confirmation dialog for role and stakeholder type deletion, with detailed impact messages.

- Roles and Stakeholders listing pages support role deletion through a contextual menu, using react-query mutations to ensure data reflects changes immediately.

- Minor UI copy adjustments in the `AddRoleModal` clarify the distinction between adding a new role and a stakeholder type.

These improvements ensure users are informed and deliberate when performing potentially destructive actions, enhancing the application's overall consistency.
