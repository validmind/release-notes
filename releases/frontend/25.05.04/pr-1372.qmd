This update introduces delete buttons and confirmation dialogs to the list and detail pages for roles and stakeholder types, enhancing user control. Group deletion now uses a reusable component, improving styling consistency. An `API.ts` call for deleting roles has been added. The stakeholder type settings menu item is now included as per ValidMind documentation. The roles detail page is adapted for stakeholder types with minor differences, and the API roles delete endpoint is reused for stakeholder type deletion requests.

This update enhances role deletion and confirmation dialogs within the application for a more consistent user experience. Key improvements include a new `DeleteRole` API method for role deletion, a standardized `DeleteConfirmationAlert` component for consistent confirmation dialogs, and updated styling for `DangerMenuItem` to highlight destructive actions. The RoleDetails page now supports role and stakeholder type deletion with detailed impact messages. Roles and Stakeholders pages allow role deletion via a contextual menu, using react-query mutations for immediate data updates. Minor UI copy changes in `AddRoleModal` clarify the distinction between adding roles and stakeholder types.

- A new `DeleteRole` API method supports role deletion via an Axios DELETE endpoint.

- The `DeleteConfirmationAlert` component standardizes deletion confirmation across Group, RoleDetails, Roles, and Stakeholders pages, providing consistent user experience and custom messages.

- `DangerMenuItem` styling is refined to better indicate destructive actions with adjusted color and background properties.

- The RoleDetails page supports role and stakeholder type deletion with integrated confirmation dialogs and detailed impact messages.

- Roles and Stakeholders pages enable role deletion through a contextual menu, using react-query mutations to ensure immediate data updates.

- UI copy adjustments in `AddRoleModal` clarify the difference between adding a new role and a stakeholder type.

These changes ensure users are well-informed and deliberate when performing potentially destructive actions, enhancing the consistency of deletion flows throughout the application.
