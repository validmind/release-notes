This update introduces delete buttons and confirmation dialogs to both the roles list and detail pages, as well as the stakeholder types list and detail pages. Group deletion now uses a reusable component with improved styling for consistency. An `API.ts` call has been implemented for deleting roles, which is also used for stakeholder type deletions. Additionally, a stakeholder type settings menu item has been added according to the documentation.

- Added delete buttons and confirmation dialogs to the roles and stakeholder types lists and detail pages.

- Updated group deletion to use a reusable component with improved styling.

- Implemented an `API.ts` call for deleting roles, reused for stakeholder type deletions.

- Added the stakeholder type settings menu item as per the documentation.

This update enhances role deletion and confirmation dialogs in the application. Key improvements include:

- A new `DeleteRole` API method for role deletion via an Axios DELETE endpoint.
- A standardized `DeleteConfirmationAlert` component for consistent deletion confirmations across multiple pages, including Group, RoleDetails, Roles, and Stakeholders.
- Updated `DangerMenuItem` styling to better indicate destructive actions.
- RoleDetails now supports role and stakeholder type deletion with detailed impact messages.
- Roles and Stakeholders pages allow role deletion via a contextual menu, using react-query mutations to ensure immediate data updates.
- Minor UI copy adjustments in `AddRoleModal` to distinguish between adding roles and stakeholder types.

These changes improve deletion flow consistency, ensuring users are informed and deliberate when performing destructive actions.
