A new trigger type, "On Model Field Change," is now available when creating workflows. This feature lets you monitor specific inventory model fields for changes before initiating workflow execution.

This update enhances the workflow management component and its API service, improving flexibility and user interface dynamics. Key changes include API adjustments for URL formatting and the addition of an optional `triggerFieldKey` parameter in the `PostWorkflow` API call. The Workflow Modal now supports a new `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger type, allowing users to select specific fields to trigger workflows. Enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` have been updated to support these enhancements.

- **API Changes:**
  - The `GET` endpoint now correctly formats the URL string by removing an unnecessary line break.
  - Added an optional `triggerFieldKey` parameter to the `PostWorkflow` API call for capturing custom trigger field keys.

- **Workflow Modal Enhancements:**
  - Imports additional context and utility methods, using `UsersContext` and `getSchemaPropertyByKey` to build a list of available fields.
  - Introduces a `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger type, displaying a dropdown for field selection.
  - Supports dynamic behavior based on the trigger type, capturing and passing `field_name` to the API.
  - Resets error states on modal open/close and adjusts entity names and event types based on the trigger.

- **Model Updates:**
  - Extended enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` to support the `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger.
