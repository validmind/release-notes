A new trigger type, "On Model Field Change," is now available when creating workflows. This feature lets you monitor changes in a specific inventory model field before initiating workflow execution.

This update enhances the workflow management component and its API service, improving flexibility and user interface dynamics. Key changes include API adjustments for URL formatting and the addition of an optional `triggerFieldKey` parameter. The Workflow Modal now supports dynamic behavior with a new `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger type, allowing users to select specific fields to trigger workflows. Enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` have been updated to support these enhancements.

- **API Changes**: The GET endpoint now correctly formats the URL string by removing an unnecessary line break. The `PostWorkflow` API call includes a new optional parameter, `triggerFieldKey`, for capturing a custom trigger field key.

- **Workflow Modal Enhancements**: The modal imports additional context and utility methods, using `UsersContext` and `getSchemaPropertyByKey` to build a list of available fields. A new `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger type allows users to select a specific field to trigger workflows. The modal supports dynamic behavior based on the trigger type, resetting error states upon open/close and adjusting entity names and event types accordingly.

- **Model Updates**: Enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` now include the `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger, supporting both field-based modifications and traditional events.
