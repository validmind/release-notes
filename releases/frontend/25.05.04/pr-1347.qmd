A new trigger type, "On Model Field Change," is now available when creating workflows. This feature lets you monitor changes in a specific inventory model field before initiating workflow execution.

This update enhances the workflow management component and its API service, improving flexibility and user interface dynamics for workflow creation and editing.

- **API Changes:**
  - The `GET` endpoint now correctly formats the URL string by removing an unnecessary line break.
  - A new optional parameter, `triggerFieldKey`, is available in the `PostWorkflow` API call to capture a custom trigger field key.

- **Workflow Modal Enhancements:**
  - The modal imports additional context and utility methods, using `UsersContext` and `getSchemaPropertyByKey` to build a list of fields from the organization's inventory model schema.
  - A new trigger type, `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE`, allows users to select a specific field to trigger the workflow.
  - The modal supports dynamic behavior based on the trigger type, capturing and passing the `field_name` to the API when `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` is selected.
  - Error states reset upon modal open/close, and entity names and event types adjust based on the trigger type.

- **Model Updates:**
  - Enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` now include the `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger, supporting both field-based modifications and traditional events.
