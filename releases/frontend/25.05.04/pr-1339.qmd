This update introduces a new feature for 'soft-deleting' workflows. When a workflow is deleted, users can continue any executions currently using the deleted workflow. However, the workflow will be removed from the active workflows listing, and future executions will be prevented from running.

This update enables workflow deletion while checking for dependencies between workflows and associated models.

API Enhancements:

- `GetWorkflowModelDependenciesCount` retrieves the number of models depending on a workflow, warning users of potential impacts before deletion.
- `DeleteWorkflow` sends a DELETE request to remove a specified workflow.

New UI Components:

- `WorkflowDeleteModal` offers a confirmation dialog for deleting workflows, displaying warnings if models depend on the workflow and handling success and error scenarios with toast notifications.
- `ExecutionDetails` shows an alert if a workflow has been deleted, ensuring users know that while the workflow is deprecated, current executions continue normally.
- `WorkflowList` now includes a delete option, triggering the dependency count check and opening the delete modal for safer workflow deletion.

Model Update:

- A `deleted_at` field has been added to the Workflow model to track when a workflow is deleted, allowing the UI to conditionally render warnings.

These changes provide a robust mechanism for workflow deletion, preventing accidental removal when dependencies exist and improving user feedback during the deletion process.
