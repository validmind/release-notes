This update introduces a new feature for 'soft-deleting' workflows. When a workflow is deleted, ongoing executions using the deleted workflow can continue. However, the workflow will be removed from the active workflows list, and future executions will be prevented.

This update allows users to delete workflows while checking for dependencies with associated models. 

API Enhancements:

- `GetWorkflowModelDependenciesCount`: Retrieves the number of models depending on a workflow, warning users of potential impacts before deletion.
- `DeleteWorkflow`: Sends a DELETE request to remove a specified workflow.

New UI Components:

- `WorkflowDeleteModal`: Provides a confirmation dialog for deleting workflows, displaying warnings if models depend on the workflow and handling success and error scenarios with notifications.
- `ExecutionDetails`: Shows an alert if a workflow has been deleted, clarifying that current executions continue normally.
- `WorkflowList`: Includes a delete option that checks dependencies and opens the delete modal for safer workflow deletion.

Model Update:

- A `deleted_at` field has been added to the Workflow model to track deletions, enabling the UI to render warnings conditionally.

These changes enhance workflow deletion, preventing accidental removal when dependencies exist and improving user feedback.
