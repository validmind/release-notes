This update introduces a new feature for 'soft-deleting' workflows. When a workflow is deleted, ongoing executions using the deleted workflow can continue. However, the workflow will be removed from the active workflows list, and future executions will be prevented.

This update enables workflow deletion while checking for dependencies between workflows and associated models. 

API Enhancements:

- `GetWorkflowModelDependenciesCount` retrieves the number of models depending on a workflow, warning users of potential impacts before deletion.
- `DeleteWorkflow` sends a DELETE request to remove a specified workflow.

New UI Components:

- `WorkflowDeleteModal` offers a confirmation dialog for deleting workflows, displaying warnings if models depend on the workflow and handling success and error notifications.
- `ExecutionDetails` alerts users if a workflow has been deleted, clarifying that current executions will continue normally.
- `WorkflowList` includes a delete option that checks dependencies before opening the delete modal, ensuring safer workflow deletion.

Model Update:

- A `deleted_at` field has been added to the Workflow model to track deletions, allowing the UI to render warnings conditionally.

These changes enhance workflow deletion by preventing accidental removal when dependencies exist and improving user feedback during the process.
