#### External Release Notes
This PR introduces a new feature to allow 'soft-deleting' workflows. Deleting a workflow will allow users to continue executions that are currently using the deleted workflow but will remove it from active workflows listing and prevent future executions from running

# PR Summary

This PR introduces functionality to delete workflows along with an additional check for dependencies between workflows and associated models. The key changes include:

1. API Enhancements:
   - New function GetWorkflowModelDependenciesCount: This function retrieves the number of models depending on a given workflow. It is used to warn users of potential impact before deletion.
   - New function DeleteWorkflow: This function sends a DELETE request to remove the specified workflow.

2. New UI Components:
   - A new component, WorkflowDeleteModal, has been introduced. This modal provides a confirmation dialog for deleting workflows. It displays additional warnings if the workflow is used by models (using the dependency count), and handles success and error scenarios with toast notifications.
   - Enhancements in the ExecutionDetails component: An alert is shown to indicate if a workflow has been deleted, ensuring users understand that although the workflow is deprecated, current executions continue normally.
   - Integration into WorkflowList: The workflow listing page now includes a delete option. It triggers the dependency count check and then opens the delete modal, facilitating safer deletion of workflows.

3. Model Update:
   - A new field 'deleted_at' has been added to the Workflow model to track when a workflow has been deleted, which is then used by the UI to conditionally render warnings.

Overall, these changes aim to provide a robust mechanism for workflow deletion that prevents accidental removal when dependencies exist, and improves user feedback during the deletion process.
