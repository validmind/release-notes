This update integrates the DOMPurify library to sanitize HTML content before using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React components, effectively preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. DOMPurify version 3.2.5 is implemented, with the `sanitizeHtml` utility function configured to allow the "target" attribute on links while sanitizing all other potentially harmful HTML content.

This update enhances security by integrating DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content before rendering with React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Key changes include:

- Adding DOMPurify to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for HTML sanitization.
- Introducing a `sanitizeHtml` utility function in the `utils` module, wrapping `DOMPurify.sanitize` for use across components.
- Updating components like `CommandPalette`, `DocumentChecker`, `FindingsList`, `GenerateWithAIModal`, `JSONLogicHumanizer`, `CustomText`, and `TemplateEditor` to sanitize HTML content, preventing XSS attacks.
- Implementing minor code formatting improvements and small refactors for consistency.

These changes enhance security by ensuring dynamic HTML content is sanitized before DOM injection, contributing to safer rendering of content from external sources or user inputs.
