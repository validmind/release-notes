The DOMPurify library has been added to sanitize HTML content before using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React components. This update prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by ensuring all HTML is sanitized through a centralized utility function before rendering. Previously, unsanitized HTML was directly rendered, posing security risks.

DOMPurify version 3.2.5 is implemented. The `sanitizeHtml` utility function is configured to allow the "target" attribute on links while sanitizing all other potentially dangerous HTML content.

This update enhances security by integrating `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML content before rendering with React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Key changes include:

- Adding `DOMPurify` to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Introducing a `sanitizeHtml` utility function in the `utils` module.
- Updating components like `CommandPalette`, `DocumentChecker`, and others to sanitize HTML, preventing XSS attacks.
- Minor code formatting improvements for consistency.

These changes ensure safer rendering of dynamic HTML content.
