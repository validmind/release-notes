The DOMPurify library has been integrated to sanitize HTML content before using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React components, enhancing security by preventing XSS attacks. This update ensures all HTML is sanitized through a centralized utility function before rendering. DOMPurify version 3.2.5 is implemented, with the `sanitizeHtml` utility function configured to permit the "target" attribute on links while sanitizing other potentially harmful HTML content.

This update enhances security by integrating DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content before rendering with React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Key changes include:

- Added DOMPurify to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for HTML sanitization.
- Introduced a `sanitizeHtml` utility function that wraps `DOMPurify.sanitize`.
- Updated components like `CommandPalette`, `DocumentChecker`, `FindingsList`, and others to sanitize HTML content, preventing XSS attacks.
- Made minor code formatting improvements for consistency.

These changes ensure safer rendering of dynamic HTML content.
