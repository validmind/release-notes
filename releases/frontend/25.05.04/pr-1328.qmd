A new feature has been added that allows users to update documents using a template. This feature enables merging a template into an existing document, offering options to selectively add, ignore, delete, or retain changes.

This update introduces key functional enhancements and UI improvements:

- **Dependency Updates**: The project version is now 1.33.4. New dependencies like `@minoru/react-dnd-treeview` and `react-dnd` enhance drag-and-drop capabilities for template manipulation.

- **API Enhancements**: The `SwapTemplate` function is replaced by `CreateAndSwapTemplate`, consolidating template creation and swapping into one API call for better clarity and reusability.

- **UI Modifications**: Updates to components such as `AddFindingModal` and `AttributesRailDocumentOverview` refine user interactions. Changes include updated trigger labels, enhanced menu layouts, and consistent use of Chakra UI components for template operations.

- **Swap Template Modal**: A new `SwapTemplateModal` component offers a drag-and-drop tree view for comparing templates. Users can mark sections with statuses like ADD, KEEP, IGNORE, or DELETE, and resolve invalid configurations before applying changes.

- **Template Model Adjustments**: Minor model changes include making the parent section optional and adding a `global_id` field to support new swapping logic.

These updates aim to streamline and enhance the management and swapping of document templates.
