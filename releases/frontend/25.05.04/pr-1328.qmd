This update introduces a feature that allows users to update documents using a template. Users can merge a template into an existing document and choose to selectively add, ignore, delete, or retain changes.

This update introduces key functional enhancements and UI improvements to streamline document template management:

- **Dependency Updates**: The project version is now 1.33.4, with new dependencies like `@minoru/react-dnd-treeview` and `react-dnd` for advanced drag-and-drop capabilities.

- **API Enhancements**: The `SwapTemplate` function is replaced by `CreateAndSwapTemplate`, consolidating template creation and swapping into a single API call for better clarity and reusability.

- **UI Modifications**: Updates to components such as `AddFindingModal` and `AttributesRailDocumentOverview` enhance user interactions. Changes include clearer trigger labels, improved layout, and integration of menu components for template management.

- **Swap Template Modal**: A new `SwapTemplateModal` component offers a drag-and-drop tree view for comparing templates. Users can mark sections with statuses like ADD, KEEP, IGNORE, or DELETE, and the UI assists in resolving invalid configurations.

- **Template Model Adjustments**: Minor changes include making the parent section optional and adding a `global_id` field to support new swapping logic.

These enhancements aim to provide a more interactive and efficient approach to managing document templates.
