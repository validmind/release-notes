A new feature now allows users to update documents using a template. This enhancement lets you merge a template into an existing document, providing options to selectively add, ignore, delete, or retain changes.

This update introduces key functional enhancements and UI improvements to streamline document template management. The project version is updated to 1.33.4, with new dependencies for drag-and-drop functionality. The `SwapTemplate` function is replaced by `CreateAndSwapTemplate` for improved API efficiency. UI components like `AddFindingModal` have been refined for better user interaction. A new `SwapTemplateModal` allows users to compare and manage templates using a drag-and-drop interface. Template model adjustments support these enhancements.

- **Dependency Updates**: The project version has been updated from 1.33.3 to 1.33.4. New dependencies related to drag-and-drop functionality, such as `@minoru/react-dnd-treeview` and `react-dnd`, have been added to enable advanced template manipulation capabilities.

- **API Enhancements**: The old `SwapTemplate` function has been removed and replaced by a new function, `CreateAndSwapTemplate`, which consolidates the creation and swapping of document templates into a single API call. This improves clarity and reusability in handling template updates.

- **UI Modifications and Component Updates**: Several UI components, including `AddFindingModal`, `AttributesRailDocumentOverview`, `AttributesRailMonitoringOverview`, and `AttributesRailValidationReportOverview`, have been updated to refine user interactions. Notable changes include:
  
  - Updated trigger labels, such as changing "Add Finding" to "Add Model Finding" for improved clarity.
  
  - Enhanced layout and integration of menu components with options to view template details or initiate a template update.
  
  - Consistent use of Chakra UI components with added modals and menus for handling template view and swap operations.

- **Swap Template Modal**: A comprehensive new component, `SwapTemplateModal`, has been introduced. This modal provides a drag-and-drop tree view allowing users to compare the active working template with a selected template version. Users can mark sections and blocks with statuses such as ADD, KEEP, IGNORE, or DELETE, and the UI guides them to resolve any invalid configurations before applying changes.

- **Template Model Adjustments**: Minor modifications in the template model include making the parent section optional and introducing a `global_id` field, which help support the new swapping logic.

Overall, these changes focus on providing a more streamlined and interactive approach to managing and swapping document templates within the application.
