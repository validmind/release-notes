We have introduced an option to include comments in monitoring and documentation reports when exporting documents. By default, exporting comments is disabled, similar to existing export settings. This feature allows users to view comments that were made. Only resolved comments are included and appear at the end of the document.

This update introduces UI enhancements and additional configuration options in export modals for Model Documentation, Validation Report, and Monitoring Report. 

Key changes include:

- A new "Include comments" checkbox in each modal allows users to decide if comments should be included in the exported file. This option is managed with a new state variable and included in the API call.

- UI improvements involve replacing certain layout components with more consistent alternatives, like using `HStack` for grouping text and popover components, enhancing alignment and spacing.

- The `MoreInfoPopOver` component is now integrated directly within the header or section text, providing contextual help for document exporting.

- Minor adjustments to spacing and `aria-label` attributes have been made to buttons, particularly the download buttons, to improve accessibility.

Overall, these changes streamline the configuration experience for generating export documents by removing redundant file format selections and focusing on a single checkbox option for including comments.
