#### What
<!-- Describe what the change is doing, including behavior before and after the change -->
We would like the ability for comments to also be exported from monitoring reports and documentation reports. Same as the existing flags, exporting comments defaults to off.

This is a follow up to this [pr where I added this new field](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/1359) for the validation reports.

#### Why
<!-- Explain why the change is being made and needed -->
Customers want the option to view comments that were made.

#### External Release Notes
<!--- REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION --->
This adds the option to include comments left in monitoring reports and documentation reports when exporting the document. Comments are included at the end of the document. Only comments that have been resolved are included in the document.

# PR Summary

This pull request introduces several UI enhancements and additional configuration options in export modals across the application. In particular, the changes focus on improving the export experience for Model Documentation, Validation Report, and Monitoring Report modals.

Key changes include:

- Introduction of a new "Include comments" checkbox in each modal. This new option allows users to control whether comments should be included in the exported file. The state is managed using a new state variable and is passed to the API call accordingly.

- UI improvements have been made by replacing certain layout components with more consistent alternatives (e.g., using HStack for grouping text and popover components). This enhances alignment and spacing for a more coherent user experience.

- The MoreInfoPopOver component is now integrated directly within the header or section text to provide users with contextual help regarding document exporting.

- Minor adjustments to spacing and aria-label attributes have been added to buttons (specifically the download buttons) to improve accessibility.

- Overall, the changes streamline the configuration experience for generating export documents, omitting redundant file format selection in favor of a single, focused checkbox option for comments inclusion.
