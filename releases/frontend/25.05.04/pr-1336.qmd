This update enhances error handling by displaying detailed error messages from the backend instead of just error codes. If a specific message is unavailable, the default error message will be shown. Additionally, a bug in the organization onboarding flow has been fixed to improve error handling.

This update improves error handling in the `BootstrapForm` component by prioritizing detailed API error messages over generic ones. When an organization creation fails, the form now displays the API's specific error message (`error.response?.data?.message`) instead of a generic `error.message`. This message is stored in a local variable (`errorMessage`) and used consistently in both inline error displays and toast notifications, enhancing troubleshooting and user guidance.
