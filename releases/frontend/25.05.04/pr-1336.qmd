Users will now see detailed error messages from the backend instead of just error codes. If a specific message is unavailable, the default message will be displayed. Additionally, error handling in the organization onboarding flow has been improved.

This update improves error handling in the `BootstrapForm` component by prioritizing detailed error messages from the API response (`error.response?.data?.message`) over generic ones (`error.message`). The selected error message is stored in a local variable (`errorMessage`) and used consistently in both inline error displays and toast notifications. This ensures more effective troubleshooting and user guidance by utilizing descriptive backend error messages when available.
