# PR Summary

This PR enhances the error handling logic in the BootstrapForm component. The form now prioritizes displaying a detailed error message retrieved from the API response (via error.response?.data?.message) over the generic error.message. This change improves the clarity of error feedback provided to the user during organization creation failures. Specifically, the code now stores the chosen error message in a local variable (errorMessage) and uses it consistently in both inline error displays and toast notifications.

These updates ensure that if the backend supplies a more descriptive error message, it will be used, making troubleshooting and user guidance more effective.
