This update enhances error handling by displaying detailed error messages from the backend instead of just error codes. If a specific message is unavailable, the default message will still appear. Additionally, a bug fix improves error handling during the organization onboarding process.

This update improves error handling in the `BootstrapForm` component by prioritizing detailed API response error messages (`error.response?.data?.message`) over generic ones (`error.message`). This change enhances clarity in error feedback during organization creation failures. The selected error message is stored in a local variable (`errorMessage`) and consistently used in both inline error displays and toast notifications, ensuring more effective troubleshooting and user guidance.
