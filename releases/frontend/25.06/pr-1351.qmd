Added `workflow approval step voter notes` to the activity log for better tracking and transparency in approval processes.

This update introduces several UI enhancements and refactors:

- In the `EventRowLayout` component, collapsible content now displays additional details, such as vote notes, when available. An `IconButton` toggles a `Collapse` element, with the icon switching between a downward and upward chevron.

- New components for workflow approvals:
  - `ApprovalActionButtons`: A button group for approving or rejecting votes with color schemes and icons.
  - `ApprovalHeader`: Displays the approval title and message in a structured layout.
  - `ApprovalVoterCard`: Shows voter information with an optional popover for vote notes.
  - `VoteDetailsModal`: A modal for viewing vote notes in a read-only textarea.
  - `VoterStatusColumn` and constants: Display voter statuses in columns based on their vote state with a uniform look.

- Redundant code and inline comments have been replaced with reusable components, improving maintainability and readability.
