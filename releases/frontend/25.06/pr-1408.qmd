The update changes the user interface as shown in the screenshot. There are no breaking changes.

This update enhances error handling in workflow components:

- The `UserActionButtons` component now uses an `Alert` to display error messages for failed API calls.
- The `StateSetNode` and `StatusSetNode` components use `NodeBox` to show error messages when API errors occur during data fetching.
- The `WorkflowsPage` provides detailed error responses for API calls. The `onError` callback distinguishes between basic API errors and validation errors. Validation errors trigger individual toast notifications with contextual information, while a general error toast is shown for other errors.
