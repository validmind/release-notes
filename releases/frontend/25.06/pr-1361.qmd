Documentation sections no longer include default text blocks. An empty state now prompts users to "Add New Block."

Fixed a bug where some sections were not deleted.

The `BlockExplorer` component's menu rendering logic has been refactored for better flexibility and reusability. Key changes include:

- A `MenuWrapper` component consolidates menu display logic with `DocumentBlockModal` configuration.
- `BlockExplorerProps` now includes an optional `customRender` property for customized UI behavior, such as an empty state with an "Add New Block" button.
- `DocumentationPage` uses `customRender` to provide a context-sensitive empty state, prompting users to start building the section. The `MenuButton` triggers focus using the `setIsFocused` callback.
- The `getInitialSectionContents` function now returns an empty array instead of a default content block.

These updates enhance modularity, reduce duplication, and give developers more control over block and menu rendering.
