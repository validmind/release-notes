Backend errors now display helpful messages instead of error codes. If no specific message is available, a default message will appear. A bug fix improves error handling during the organization onboarding process.

The update enhances error handling in the `BootstrapForm` component by prioritizing detailed API error messages (`error.response?.data?.message`) over generic ones (`error.message`). The selected error message is stored in a local variable (`errorMessage`) and used consistently for inline error displays and toast notifications, improving troubleshooting and user guidance.
