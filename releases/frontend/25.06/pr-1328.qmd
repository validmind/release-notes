A new feature enables documents to be `Updated from Template`. Users can merge a template into an existing document, choosing to add, ignore, delete, or retain specific changes.

This update introduces several functional enhancements and UI improvements:

- **Dependency Updates**: The project version is now 1.33.4. New dependencies, `@minoru/react-dnd-treeview` and `react-dnd`, have been added for advanced template manipulation.

- **API Enhancements**: The `SwapTemplate` function is now `CreateAndSwapTemplate`, combining template creation and swapping into a single API call for improved clarity and reusability.

- **UI Modifications and Component Updates**: Components such as `AddFindingModal`, `AttributesRailDocumentOverview`, `AttributesRailMonitoringOverview`, and `AttributesRailValidationReportOverview` have been updated to enhance user interactions. Updates include revised trigger labels, improved layout and menu integration for templates, and consistent use of Chakra UI components.

- **Swap Template Modal**: A new `SwapTemplateModal` component provides a drag-and-drop tree view for comparing the active template with a selected version. Users can mark sections and blocks with statuses like ADD, KEEP, IGNORE, or DELETE, and the UI assists in resolving invalid configurations before applying changes.

- **Template Model Adjustments**: Minor changes include making the parent section optional and adding a `global_id` field to support the new swapping logic.
