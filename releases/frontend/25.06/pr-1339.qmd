The update introduces a `soft-deleting` feature for workflows. When a workflow is deleted, users can still continue any ongoing executions, but it will be removed from active listings to prevent future executions.

This update introduces the ability to delete workflows, with checks for dependencies on associated models.

API Enhancements:
- `GetWorkflowModelDependenciesCount`: Retrieves the number of models depending on a workflow to warn users of potential impacts before deletion.
- `DeleteWorkflow`: Sends a DELETE request to remove the specified workflow.

New UI Components:
- `WorkflowDeleteModal`: Provides a confirmation dialog for deleting workflows, displaying warnings if the workflow is used by models and handling success and error scenarios with toast notifications.
- `ExecutionDetails`: Alerts users if a workflow has been deleted, ensuring they understand that while the workflow is deprecated, current executions continue normally.
- `WorkflowList`: Includes a delete option that triggers the dependency count check and opens the delete modal, facilitating safer workflow deletion.

Model Update:
- A new field, `deleted_at`, has been added to the Workflow model to track when a workflow has been deleted, used by the UI to conditionally render warnings.
