Delete buttons and confirmation prompts are now available on the list and detail pages for roles and stakeholder types. The group deletion process uses a reusable component with improved styling. An `API.ts` call for deleting roles has been introduced. The stakeholder type settings menu item is added as per documentation.

The roles details page is reused for the stakeholder type detail page with minor differences. The API roles delete endpoint is also reused for stakeholder type deletion requests.

This update enhances role deletion and confirmation dialogs in the application.

- A new API method, `DeleteRole`, enables role deletion via an Axios `DELETE` endpoint.

- The `DeleteConfirmationAlert` component standardizes the deletion confirmation process across pages like Group, RoleDetails, Roles, and Stakeholders, with custom messages for consistency.

- Updated styling for components like `DangerMenuItem` highlights destructive actions with adjusted color and background properties.

- The RoleDetails page now includes a confirmation dialog for deleting roles and stakeholder types, providing detailed messages about the action's impact.

- The Roles and Stakeholders listing pages enable role deletion via a contextual menu, using react-query mutations to trigger deletion and ensure immediate data updates.

- Minor UI copy adjustments in the `AddRoleModal` clarify the difference between adding a new role and a stakeholder type.
