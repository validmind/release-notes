Settings and document types are now enabled. View a demo [here](https://www.loom.com/share/48203f7c757c4de781d210101d785cb1).

Stage 2 will focus on team collaboration for full integration, including permission settings for managing document types and creating generic template page content using new endpoints.

This update enhances the Document Types feature, improving both the API and frontend UI components.

- **API Enhancements**:
  - New endpoints support list, get, create, update, and delete operations for document types using `Axios`.
  - Methods for retrieving model document details ensure cohesion between document types and model documents.
  - Improved error handling addresses potential issues in `Axios` responses.

- **Frontend UI Components**:
  - A new route (`/settings/document-types/*`) directs users to the Document Types management section, with a dedicated sidebar entry when the feature flag is enabled.
  - New React components and hooks, such as `DocumentTypesList`, `DocumentTypeModal`, `DeleteDocumentTypeModal`, and `useDocumentTypes`, support listing, creating, editing, and deleting document types.
  - UI components include validations to ensure fields like name and slug are correctly filled and formatted.

- **Configuration & Infrastructure**:
  - The feature is conditionally enabled using a feature flag (`documentTypes`).
  - TypeScript configuration files have been adjusted to change the module resolution from `bundler` to `node`, affecting module imports and compatibility.
  - Minor code enhancements in existing pages, such as the Model Inventory Overview, improve robustness with optional chaining for safety.
