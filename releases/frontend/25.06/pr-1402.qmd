The `DOMPurify` library sanitizes HTML content before applying `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React components to prevent XSS attacks. The `sanitizeHtml` utility function is configured to allow the `target` attribute on links while sanitizing other potentially harmful HTML content. This implementation uses `DOMPurify` version 3.2.5.

This update enhances security by using `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML content with React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Key changes include:

- Adding `DOMPurify` to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Introducing a `sanitizeHtml` utility function in the `utils` module, wrapping `DOMPurify.sanitize` for use across multiple components.
- Updating components like `CommandPalette`, `DocumentChecker`, `FindingsList`, `GenerateWithAIModal`, `JSONLogicHumanizer`, `CustomText`, and `TemplateEditor` to sanitize dynamic HTML content, preventing potential XSS attacks.
- Implementing minor code formatting improvements and small refactors for consistency.
