The settings page has been reorganized to better categorize settings, enhancing readability and making it easier for users to understand the purpose of each setting.

This update refactors the settings user interface by reorganizing and grouping navigation links into logical sections. The sidebar now clearly distinguishes between areas like "Your Account", "Workspace", "User Permissions", "Models", and "Documents". Key changes include moving the "Stakeholders" link to a model-specific section, introducing conditional rendering for admin features, adjusting link order, and enhancing component structure for better readability and accessibility.

The "Stakeholders" link is now under a model-specific section and renamed "Model Stakeholder Types" where applicable. Admin features like "Workflows" and "Workflow States" are conditionally displayed based on user permissions, such as `isAdmin` and `workflowsV3`. The order and grouping of links are adjusted to provide a more intuitive navigation experience based on user roles. The component structure is improved by replacing some `Box` components with `Stack` and using the `Heading` component for titles, enhancing readability and accessibility.

These changes aim to improve the maintainability, user experience, and adaptability of the settings interface based on user roles and permissions.
