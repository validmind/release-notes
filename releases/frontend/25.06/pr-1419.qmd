The settings page has been reorganized for improved readability, helping users understand each setting's purpose.

The update refactors the settings user interface by organizing navigation links into sections. The sidebar now separates `Your Account`, `Workspace`, `User Permissions`, `Models`, and `Documents`. Key changes include:

- Moving the `Stakeholders` link to a model-specific section and renaming it `Model Stakeholder Types` where applicable.
- Introducing conditional rendering for admin features like `Workflows` and `Workflow States`, shown only when user permissions (e.g., `isAdmin` and `workflowsV3`) are met.
- Adjusting the order of links for more intuitive navigation based on user roles.
- Enhancing component structure by replacing some `Box` components with `Stack` and using the `Heading` component for titles, improving readability and accessibility.
