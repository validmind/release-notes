We added an option to include only resolved comments in exported monitoring and documentation reports. This feature is off by default and addresses customer requests for viewing comments in reports.

This update enhances the UI and adds configuration options in export modals for Model Documentation, Validation Report, and Monitoring Report.

Key changes include:

- An "Include comments" checkbox in each modal allows users to choose whether to include comments in the exported file. This is managed with a new state variable and passed to the API call.

- UI improvements using `HStack` for better alignment and spacing of text and popover components.

- Integration of the `MoreInfoPopOver` component within headers or section text to provide contextual help for document exporting.

- Adjustments to spacing and `aria-label` attributes on download buttons to improve accessibility.
