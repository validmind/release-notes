The `On Model Field Change` trigger type is now available for workflows, allowing you to monitor changes in an inventory model field before executing a workflow.

This pull request improves the workflow management component and its API service:

- **API Changes**:
  - The `GET` endpoint now correctly formats the URL string by removing an unnecessary line break.
  - An optional `triggerFieldKey` parameter has been added to the `PostWorkflow` API call to capture a custom trigger field key.

- **Workflow Modal Enhancements**:
  - The Workflow Modal component uses `UsersContext` and `getSchemaPropertyByKey` to list available fields from the organization's inventory model schema.
  - A new workflow trigger type, `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE`, has been added. When selected, a dropdown lets users choose the specific field that will trigger the workflow.
  - The modal supports dynamic behavior based on the selected trigger type, capturing and passing the `field_name` to the API when `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` is chosen.
  - Error states reset upon modal open/close, and conditional logic adjusts entity names and event types based on the trigger type.

- **Model Updates**:
  - Enumerations for `TriggerType`, `EntityName`, and `EntityEventType` have been extended to support the new `MODEL_FIELD_CHANGE` trigger, enabling workflows to handle both field-based modifications and traditional events.
