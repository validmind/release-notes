The update adds a new `Run Workflow` step for executing manual-trigger workflows and improves the styling of workflow node boxes for consistent coloring, outlines, and selection across all views. Note: This update includes a breaking change related to backend updates.

This update includes key enhancements and bug fixes:

- Components use theme defaults for spinner colors, ensuring consistent styling.

- The `GetWorkflows` function now supports pagination and optional filtering by trigger type. The new `GetWorkflowDependencies` function retrieves model dependency counts and lists workflows dependent on a given workflow, aiding in deletion decisions.

- The workflow deletion modal displays a warning alert and a list of dependent workflows with links, disabling the delete button if necessary.

- A new run workflow node and panel allow users to trigger another workflow. It integrates into the workflow canvas with UI components and supports configuration via an inline dropdown that paginates workflow options using the `useWorkflows` hook.

- Minor UI tweaks have been made to node components, such as border styling and rounding updates. Inline inspection popovers and contextual data displays in components like `NodeBox` assist in debugging and troubleshooting workflows.
