Enhanced date formatting by adding `locale` support. Date display functions now accept `locale` as a parameter, ensuring consistent formatting across components. The user interface reflects user-specific `locale` settings in date displays throughout the application.

This update enhances date formatting and display by introducing the `FormattedDate` component and `useFormattedDateAndTime` hook, replacing older utilities. UI localization settings are now stored in `localStorage` when changed. New admin components (`OrganizationRow`, `RoleRow`, `UserRow`) simplify table row implementations. `FormattedDate` is used for date localization across admin pages, user views, activity feeds, and modals. The custom date picker dynamically loads locales and uses `FormattedDate` for display. Template, workflow execution, and profile pages now support localized date displays and user-selected locale options. These changes enhance code modularity and ensure date and time values reflect user locale preferences throughout the application.
