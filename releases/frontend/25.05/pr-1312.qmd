Enhance date formatting functionality by adding locale support. Updated date display functions to accept `locale` as a parameter, ensuring consistent formatting across various components. Adjusted the user interface to reflect user-specific locale settings in date displays throughout the application.

This update enhances date formatting and display across the application by introducing a new reusable component, `FormattedDate`, and a custom hook, `useFormattedDateAndTime`. These replace older utilities for improved localization. Key changes include:

- UI localization settings are saved to `localStorage` when updated by users.
- New admin components (`OrganizationRow`, `RoleRow`, `UserRow`) simplify table row implementations.
- Date formatting in admin pages, user views, and modals now uses `FormattedDate`.
- The custom date picker dynamically loads locales and uses `FormattedDate`.
- Template, workflow execution, and profile pages now support localized date displays and user-selected locales.

These improvements ensure consistent and localized date handling throughout the application.
