# PR Summary

This PR introduces significant improvements in how dates are formatted and displayed across various parts of the application. The changes include the creation and adoption of a new reusable component, FormattedDate, and a custom hook, useFormattedDateAndTime. These are used to replace direct calls to old formatting utilities (like displayFormattedDateAndTime) throughout the codebase. Functional updates include:

- In the main app, current UI localization settings are uploaded to localStorage on user change.
- New reusable admin components (OrganizationRow, RoleRow, and UserRow) are added for displaying organization, role, and user information respectively. These components simplify the table row implementations within admin pages.
- The date formatting across admin pages, user views, activity feed, and various modals (such as block metrics, test driven modals, and document blocks) now use the FormattedDate component to support localization.
- Update of the custom date picker in the custom fields to load locale dynamically and use FormattedDate for value display.
- Improvements in the template, workflow execution, and profile pages to support localized date displays and user-selected locale options.

These changes provide better code modularity and consistency in date handling, ensuring that date and time values reflect the user’s locale preferences throughout the application.
