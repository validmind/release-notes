Date display functions now accept a `locale` parameter, allowing you to format dates based on your preferences.

`FormattedDate` and `useFormattedDateAndTime` have replaced previous date utilities. All date displays, including admin pages, user views, templates, workflow executions, profile pages, activity feed, related modals, and the custom date picker, now align with your selected locale.

Your UI locale preference is saved to `localStorage` when changed.

New `OrganizationRow`, `RoleRow`, and `UserRow` components enhance the efficiency of admin tables.
