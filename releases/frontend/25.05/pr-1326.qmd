The Inventory Model List now features new sort columns: `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`.

New sorting options, `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`, are now available on the Model Inventory page. Users can sort these in descending (latest first) or ascending (oldest first) order. These enhancements are integrated into the existing sorting mechanism for consistency with other options. The changes are implemented in the UI component at `src/pages/ModelInventory/index.tsx`, offering users greater flexibility in managing model-related data.
