The Inventory Model List now includes two new sort columns: `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`.

This update adds two new sorting options to the Model Inventory page: "Updated Date" and "Documentation Updated Date." You can sort data in descending order (latest first) or ascending order (oldest first). These enhancements integrate with the existing sorting mechanism, offering more flexibility in viewing and managing model-related data. The changes are implemented in the UI component within `src/pages/ModelInventory/index.tsx`.
