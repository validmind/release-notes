#### External Release Notes
Adds new Sort columns to Inventory Model List `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`

# PR Summary

This PR introduces two new sorting criteria in the Model Inventory page. Specifically, it adds sorting options for both the "Updated Date" and the "Documentation Updated Date" fields. Each new sorting option allows data to be arranged in two possible orders: 

- Latest first (descending order)
- Oldest first (ascending order)

These enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing sorting mechanism by following the same structure and format used for other available sorts. The changes are confined to the addition of sorting options within the UI component located in `src/pages/ModelInventory/index.tsx`, ensuring that users have more flexibility in how they view and manage model-related data.
