# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content provides a clearer and more specific description of the feature being discussed. It specifies the addition of sorting options for both "Updated Date" and "Documentation Updated Date" within the model inventory, which aligns with the original content's intent to sort by "Last Updated." This edit enhances the clarity and usability of the information by explicitly stating the sorting criteria. Overall, the edit is effective and improves the original content.

#### External Release Notes
Adds new Sort columns to Inventory Model List `Updated Date` and `Documentation Updated Date`

# PR Summary

This PR introduces two new sorting criteria in the Model Inventory page. Specifically, it adds sorting options for both the "Updated Date" and the "Documentation Updated Date" fields. Each new sorting option allows data to be arranged in two possible orders: 

- Latest first (descending order)
- Oldest first (ascending order)

These enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing sorting mechanism by following the same structure and format used for other available sorts. The changes are confined to the addition of sorting options within the UI component located in `src/pages/ModelInventory/index.tsx`, ensuring that users have more flexibility in how they view and manage model-related data.
