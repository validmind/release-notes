To use `Code Explainer`, follow this example:

```python
from IPython.display import Markdown
from agents import code_explainer

with open("binary_classifier_code.py") as f:
    code_content = f.read()

state = {
    "inputs": {
        "additional_instructions": "Preprocessing module for binary classification",
        "source_code": code_content,
    },
    "output": "",
}

state = code_explainer.invoke(state)
Markdown(state["output"])
```

The demo notebook is available at `notebooks/code_explainer.ipynb`.
