# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It effectively communicates the same message while enhancing readability. The use of "Avoid" provides a more direct instruction, and the phrase "in `release` branch names" is more specific and easier to understand. Overall, the edit maintains the original intent while improving clarity and style. 

Quality: High
