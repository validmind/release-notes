title: "Use `main` instead of `staging` for `agents` as `staging` does not exist (#14)"

# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It provides a more complete explanation by specifying that "staging" does not exist for "agents." The use of backticks for `main`, `staging`, and `agents` helps to clearly identify them as specific terms or branches, which enhances readability and understanding. Overall, the edited content effectively communicates the intended message with improved clarity and detail.
