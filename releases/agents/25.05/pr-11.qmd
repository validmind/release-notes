# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It removes the informal "feat:" prefix, which is typically used in commit messages, and presents the information in a straightforward manner. Additionally, enclosing `prod-release` in backticks helps to emphasize it as a specific term or code element. Overall, the edited content is more professional and easier to understand.
