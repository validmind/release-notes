# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is clear and concise, effectively conveying the instruction to use the `.yaml` suffix. The capitalization of the first word improves readability, and the use of backticks around `.yaml` correctly highlights it as a code element. Overall, the edit enhances the clarity and professionalism of the original content.
