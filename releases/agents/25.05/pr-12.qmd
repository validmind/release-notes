# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It removes the informal "fix:" prefix, which is often used in commit messages but is not necessary in other contexts. The edited version also correctly formats `.yaml` with backticks, indicating it is a code or file extension, which enhances readability. Overall, the edit effectively communicates the instruction in a straightforward manner.
