This update refines authorization for the report generation endpoint in the UI reporting route. Key changes include:

- The authorization decorator on the GET endpoint now uses a generic `read` action instead of the specific `download_report` action.
- In-method permission checks are added based on the document type in the request. The endpoint performs:
  - `download_doc` authorization for `documentation-report` or `monitoring-report`.
  - `download_vr` authorization for `validation-report`.
  - A `BadRequestError` is raised for unsupported document types.

These changes ensure users have the correct permissions for the specific report type they access.
