This update refines authorization for the report generation endpoint in the UI reporting route. The authorization decorator on the GET endpoint now uses a general `read` action instead of `download_report`. In-method permission checks are added based on the document type in the request. The endpoint performs an authorization check for `download_doc` for `documentation-report` or `monitoring-report`, and `download_vr` for `validation-report`. A `BadRequestError` is raised for unsupported document types.

These changes ensure users have the correct permissions for the specific report type they wish to access.
