This update enhances authorization for the report generation endpoint in the UI reporting route. The authorization decorator on the GET endpoint now uses a generic `read` action instead of `download_report`. In-method permission checks are added based on the document type in the request:

- For `documentation-report` or `monitoring-report`, it checks `download_doc` authorization.
- For `validation-report`, it checks `download_vr` authorization.
- If the document type is unsupported, a `BadRequestError` is raised.

These changes ensure users have the correct permissions for the report type they access.
