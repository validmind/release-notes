This update refines authorization for the report generation endpoint in the UI reporting route. The authorization decorator on the GET endpoint now uses a generic `read` action. In-method permission checks are added based on the document type in the request. The endpoint performs `download_doc` authorization for `documentation-report` or `monitoring-report`, `download_vr` authorization for `validation-report`, and raises `BadRequestError` for unsupported document types. These changes ensure users have the correct permissions for the specific report type they access.
