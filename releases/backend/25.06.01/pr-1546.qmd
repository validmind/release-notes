`PYTHONPATH` ensures scripts run with the application's original base path, enabling the correct loading of code dependencies, particularly for relative imports.

Error message handling has been enhanced. Errors now appear on the console and in the HTTP response, including details like error code, message, and user guidance. For internal errors, the response will have a status code of 500, and the error will be logged with a timestamp and detailed message.

Alternative import strategies can be considered if `PYTHONPATH` is not used.

This update enhances the API and worker processes for improved robustness and maintainability:

- The `Makefile` command for running the API now includes the current backend source directory in the `PYTHONPATH`, ensuring clearer module resolution and avoiding path issues.

- The UI reporting route now invokes the report worker using module syntax with the `-m` flag, simplifying command line usage and preventing path resolution issues. Error handling is improved by checking for detailed error information before logging and propagating errors.

- Import statements in the report worker file have been refactored to use direct imports from the `db` package, replacing deeply nested module paths. This change streamlines dependencies and enhances maintainability.
