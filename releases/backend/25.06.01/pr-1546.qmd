`PYTHONPATH` ensures scripts run with the application's original base path, allowing code dependencies to load correctly, especially with relative imports.

Error messages now display correctly on the console and in the HTTP response, including the error code, message, and user guidance. The status code is 500, with details specifying the issue, such as a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Logs show detailed error messages when generating monitoring reports, including a timestamp and error description.

This update enhances the API and worker processes:

- The `Makefile` command for running the API now includes the current backend source directory in the `PYTHONPATH`, ensuring explicit module resolution and avoiding path issues.

- The UI reporting route now uses module syntax with the `-m` flag to invoke the report worker, simplifying command line use and preventing path resolution issues. Error handling is improved by checking for detailed error information before logging and propagating errors.

- Import statements in the report worker file have been refactored to import directly from the `db` package, streamlining dependencies and improving maintainability.
