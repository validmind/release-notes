This update allows scripts to be spawned with the application's original base path by setting the `PYTHONPATH`. It uses module calling syntax to correctly load code dependencies that rely on relative imports. Error message handling is improved for better visibility on the console and in HTTP responses. When an error occurs, detailed information is provided, including an error code, message, and guidance for your response. These errors are also logged for further analysis.

The update improves the robustness and maintainability of the API and worker processes. In the `Makefile`, the command for running the API now includes the current backend source directory in the `PYTHONPATH`, ensuring explicit module resolution and avoiding path issues. The UI reporting route has been enhanced by invoking the report worker using module syntax with the `-m` flag, simplifying command line invocation and reducing path resolution issues. Error handling is improved by checking for detailed error information before logging and propagating errors. Import statements in the report worker file have been refactored to import directly from the `db` package, streamlining module dependencies and improving maintainability.
