`PYTHONPATH` is now set automatically, allowing spawned scripts to inherit the application's base path. Using `python -m` invocation now loads all dependencies, including those with relative imports. Internal errors are now displayed in both the console and HTTP responses, with logs providing full stack traces for easier debugging.

You can now rely on more robust API and worker processes. The `Makefile` adds the backend source directory to `PYTHONPATH` for accurate module resolution. The UI reporting route uses `python -m` to run the report worker, simplifying commands and preventing path errors. Error handling checks for detailed information before logging or re-raising, and the report worker now imports directly from the top-level `db` package, reducing coupling.
