You can now run scripts with the correct base path. The runner sets `PYTHONPATH` and calls each script as a module, ensuring relative imports resolve properly. If a module fails to load, the app returns a structured JSON error, displays it in the console, and logs the full message for easier troubleshooting.

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report",
    "details": {
      "error": "/Users/andres/code/backend/.venv/bin/python3: Error while finding module specification for 'workers.report_worker' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'workers')\n"
    },
    "user_response": "Please search for INTERNAL_ERROR in the documentation for troubleshooting information.",
    "status": 500
  },
  "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report"
}
```

This update enhances robustness and maintainability across the API and worker processes.

- Enhanced error handling prevents unexpected failures.
- Optimized worker management improves performance.
- Refined API endpoints ensure consistent data handling.
