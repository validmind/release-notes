Setting `PYTHONPATH` automatically propagates the applicationâ€™s base path to spawned scripts, ensuring relative imports resolve correctly.

Error handling displays detailed information in the console, HTTP responses, and logs, including error codes, messages, and troubleshooting guidance. Issues like `ModuleNotFoundError` are fully recorded for easier debugging.

If you choose not to rely on `PYTHONPATH`, you can adopt alternative import strategies to achieve the same behavior.

This update improves API and worker robustness and maintainability. The Makefile adds the backend source directory to `PYTHONPATH`, clarifying module resolution and preventing path issues. The UI reporting route invokes the report worker with `python -m`, simplifying execution and avoiding path errors. Error handling checks for detailed information before logging and raising exceptions. Report worker imports use direct references to the `db` package, reducing dependencies.
