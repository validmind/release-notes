The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable now ensures scripts run with the application's original base path, aiding in the correct loading of code dependencies, especially for relative imports.

Error messages are now clearly displayed in both the console and HTTP responses:

```
{
    "error": {
        "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
        "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report",
        "details": {
            "error": "/Users/andres/code/backend/.venv/bin/python3: Error while finding module specification for 'workers.report_worker' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'workers')\n"
        },
        "user_response": "Please search for INTERNAL_ERROR in the documentation for troubleshooting information.",
        "status": 500
    },
    "message": "Failed to generate monitoring report"
}
```

Logs now accurately capture errors:

```
2025-06-04T10:20:40.062556 [error] Error generating monitoring report: /Users/andres/code/backend/.venv/bin/python3: Error while finding module specification for 'workers.report_worker' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'workers')
```

Consider alternative import strategies if not using `PYTHONPATH`.

This update improves the API and worker processes for better robustness and maintainability:

- The `Makefile` command for running the API now includes the current backend source directory in the `PYTHONPATH`, ensuring explicit module resolution and avoiding path issues.

- The UI reporting route uses module syntax with the `-m` flag to invoke the report worker, simplifying command line use and preventing path resolution issues. Error handling now checks for detailed error information before logging and propagating errors.

- Import statements in the report worker file have been refactored to import directly from the `db` package, streamlining module dependencies and enhancing maintainability.
