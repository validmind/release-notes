You can now customize finding statuses on the Settings page.

This update introduces a feature for managing the status of findings, allowing you to define custom statuses such as open, closed, and deleted. It enhances data integrity by implementing a relational approach and extends API interfaces for improved UI interaction.

The changes include a migration script that creates a new `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the `findings` table. This script backfills existing findings with old status values and removes the deprecated column. The `Finding` model is updated to replace the string-based status field with a foreign key relationship to the `FindingStatus` model, affecting serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes to ensure proper status management.

A new `FindingStatus` model is added, featuring methods for creating, updating, deleting, and loading default statuses for an organization. It includes helper methods like serialization and `mark_as_deleted`. API changes introduce new endpoints within a dedicated namespace for managing finding statuses, enforcing validations such as duplicate status names and permissions through the `requires_auth` decorator.

Related routes, including UI, reporting, and SQL views, are updated to join and filter against the new `FindingStatus` table. Organization templates and platform configurations are also updated to incorporate finding statuses. Unit tests are modified to test the new functionality for creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses as part of finding CRUD operations.
