Users can now customize status settings on the Settings page, enabling them to define their own status values for enhanced platform interaction.

This update introduces a feature for managing finding statuses, allowing organizations to define custom statuses like open, closed, or deleted.

- A migration script creates a `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the existing findings table. It backfills existing findings with old status values and removes the deprecated column.

- The `Finding` model now uses a foreign key relationship to the `FindingStatus` model, replacing the string-based status field. This change affects serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes for proper status management.

- A new `FindingStatus` model is introduced, including methods for creating, updating, deleting, and loading default statuses for an organization. It also provides helper methods like serialization and `mark_as_deleted`.

- API changes include new endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses. These endpoints validate duplicate status names and enforce permissions using the `requires_auth` decorator.

- Related routes, including UI, reporting, and SQL views, are updated to join and filter using the `FindingStatus` table.

- Organization templates and platform configurations are modified to incorporate finding statuses.

- Unit tests are adjusted to cover the new functionality for creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses as part of finding CRUD operations.

This integration enhances data integrity by adopting a relational approach and extends API interfaces for improved UI interaction.
