Users can now customize finding statuses on the Settings page. This feature allows users to define their own status values, enhancing interaction with the platform.

This update introduces a feature for managing the status of findings, allowing organizations to define custom statuses such as open, closed, or deleted. It includes a new database table and model for finding statuses, enhancing data integrity and API interfaces for improved UI interaction.

Key changes include:

- A migration script creates a `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the `findings` table, backfilling existing findings and removing the deprecated column.

- The `Finding` model now uses a foreign key to the `FindingStatus` model, affecting serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes.

- A `FindingStatus` model is introduced with methods for managing statuses, including serialization and `mark_as_deleted`.

- New API endpoints for managing finding statuses, with validations for duplicate names and permission checks using `requires_auth`.

- Updates to routes, UI, reporting, and SQL views to use the new `FindingStatus` table.

- Changes to organization templates and platform configurations to incorporate finding statuses.

- Unit tests are adjusted to cover the new functionality for managing finding statuses.
