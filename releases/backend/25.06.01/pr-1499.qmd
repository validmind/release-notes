Users can now customize finding statuses on the Settings page, enabling them to define their own `finding status` values for improved interaction with the platform.

This update introduces a feature for managing the status of findings, allowing organizations to define custom statuses like open, closed, and deleted. It includes a new database table and model for finding statuses.

Key changes:

- A migration script creates a `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the `findings` table, backfilling existing findings and removing the deprecated column.

- The `Finding` model now uses a foreign key relationship to the `FindingStatus` model, affecting serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes.

- A `FindingStatus` model is introduced with methods for creating, updating, deleting, and loading default statuses, including helper methods like serialization and `mark_as_deleted`.

- New API endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses, with validations for duplicate names and permission enforcement using the `requires_auth` decorator.

- Updates to related routes, including UI, reporting, and SQL views, to use the new `FindingStatus` table.

- Modifications to organization templates and platform configurations to incorporate finding statuses.

- Adjustments to unit tests to cover the new functionality for creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses as part of finding CRUD operations.

This integration enhances data integrity by adopting a relational approach and extends API interfaces for improved UI interaction.
