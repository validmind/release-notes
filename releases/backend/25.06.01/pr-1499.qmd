Users can now customize `finding status` values on the Settings page for a personalized experience.

This update adds a feature for managing finding statuses, allowing organizations to define custom statuses like open, closed, or deleted.

A migration script creates a `finding_statuses` table and adds a `status_id` column to the `findings` table. Existing findings are backfilled with old status values, and the deprecated column is removed. The `Finding` model now uses a foreign key to the `FindingStatus` model, affecting serialization, creation, updating, and deletion processes for status management.

A new `FindingStatus` model is introduced, with methods to create, update, delete, and load default statuses for an organization. It includes helper methods like serialization and `mark_as_deleted`. API changes add new endpoints for managing finding statuses, with validations for duplicate status names and enforced permissions using the `requires_auth` decorator.

Related routes, including UI, reporting, and SQL views, are updated to join and filter against the new `FindingStatus` table. Organization templates and platform configurations are updated to incorporate finding statuses. Unit tests are modified to test the new functionality for creating, updating, and deleting finding statuses as part of finding CRUD operations.

This integration enhances data integrity by adopting a relational approach and extends API interfaces for improved UI interaction.
