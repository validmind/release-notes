You can now customize finding statuses on the Settings page, moving beyond predefined values.

You can now create, update, delete, and retrieve custom finding statuses such as `open`, `closed`, and `deleted`. A migration introduces a `finding_statuses` table, replacing the previous string field with a `status_id` foreign key on `findings`, and automatically back-fills existing data. The Finding model, along with all related UI, reporting routes, SQL views, organization templates, and platform configurations, now references this table. New authenticated API endpoints manage statuses and prevent duplicate names.
