You can now customize finding statuses on the `Settings` page, moving beyond predefined values.

You can now define custom finding statuses (e.g., `open`, `closed`, `deleted`) for each organization. This update introduces a `finding_statuses` table and replaces the `status` string field in `findings` with a foreign-key `status_id`. A migration backfills existing data and removes the old column. The updated `Finding` and new `FindingStatus` models manage serialization, default status creation, and include a `mark_as_deleted` helper. Authenticated API endpoints allow you to list, create, update, and delete statuses, with validation to prevent duplicate names. All UI views, reports, SQL queries, organization templates, and platform configurations now reference the new table, and unit tests cover complete CRUD operations.
