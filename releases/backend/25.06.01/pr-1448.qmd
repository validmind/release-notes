Organization template exports now include `custom fields`, allowing new organizations created from a template to inherit them automatically. There are no breaking changes.

The `sanitize_custom_fields` method removes empty values, any form of `'null'` or `'n/a'`, and entries starting with `'err:'`. Organization template serialization uses this method to ensure only valid custom fields appear in the output.

When an organization is created, the system selects a user from that organization to trigger custom-field update events, applying default or template-defined fields to all related inventory models.

Inventory models are fetched by `cuid` using a direct database filter, which simplifies the query and improves error handling.

Template serialization retrieves the most recent version data instead of a static structure, with streamlined logging and error messages.
