# PR Summary

This PR introduces several functional enhancements related to custom fields and template processing in organization and inventory model management. The main changes include:

1. In the inventory model serialization, a new static method, sanitize_custom_fields, is added to process custom fields. It filters out empty fields, values that are explicitly 'null' or 'n/a' (case insensitive), and values starting with 'err:'. The method ensures that only valid custom field values are included in the serialized output of organization templates.

2. The serialization method for organization templates now includes these sanitized custom fields, providing more consistent and clean data.

3. In the organization creation workflow, after setting up a new organization, the code now retrieves a user from the new organization and triggers field update events for custom fields. This ensures that any default or template-specified custom fields are properly propagated to related inventory models.

4. An improvement in the retrieval of inventory models, replacing a list comprehension with a database filter to retrieve models by their cuid, thereby streamlining the query and error handling.

5. The template serialization in the template model has been updated to use the latest version data rather than relying on the static data structure. This allows for better handling of versioned template data.

6. Minor formatting adjustments and improvements in logging and error message consistency have been made.

Overall, these enhancements streamline the process of handling custom fields and improve the robustness of organization and template management workflows.
