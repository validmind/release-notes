The update improves the organization template export functionality by including custom fields. When you create a new organization with this template, the custom fields are automatically included, simplifying the setup process.

This update improves custom fields and template processing in organization and inventory model management, enhancing workflows and robustness.

A new static method, `sanitize_custom_fields`, is added to inventory model serialization. It filters out empty fields, values that are 'null' or 'n/a' (case insensitive), and values starting with 'err:', ensuring only valid custom field values are included in the serialized output of organization templates.

In the organization creation workflow, after setting up a new organization, a user is retrieved, and field update events for custom fields are triggered. This ensures proper propagation of default or template-specified custom fields to related inventory models.

Inventory model retrieval is improved by replacing a list comprehension with a database filter to retrieve models by `cuid`, streamlining queries and error handling. Template serialization now uses the latest version data instead of a static data structure, improving versioned template data handling.

Minor formatting adjustments and improvements in logging and error message consistency have also been made.
