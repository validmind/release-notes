The update improves the organization template export feature by including custom fields. These fields are automatically added when creating a new organization using the template, streamlining the setup process. There are no breaking changes.

This update improves custom field management and template processing in organization and inventory models.

- The `sanitize_custom_fields` static method is added to inventory model serialization. It filters out empty fields, values marked as 'null' or 'n/a' (case insensitive), and values starting with 'err:', ensuring only valid custom field values are included.

- After setting up a new organization, a user is retrieved from the organization, triggering field update events for custom fields to ensure proper propagation to related inventory models.

- Inventory model retrieval now uses a database filter instead of a list comprehension to retrieve models by `cuid`, improving query efficiency and error handling.

- Template serialization now uses the latest version data for better handling of versioned template data.

- Minor formatting adjustments and improvements in logging and error message consistency have been implemented.
