This update improves the exported organization template by adding previously missing custom fields. Their absence could complicate the setup process for new organizations. Now, when customers create a new organization using the template, these custom fields are automatically included, simplifying the setup process.

This update enhances custom fields and template processing in organization and inventory model management.

- The `sanitize_custom_fields` method now filters out empty fields, values marked as 'null' or 'n/a', and those starting with 'err:', ensuring only valid custom field values are included in serialized organization templates.

- Organization template serialization includes these sanitized custom fields for cleaner data.

- During organization creation, the system retrieves a user from the new organization and triggers custom field updates, ensuring default or template-specified fields are applied to related inventory models.

- Inventory model retrieval is improved by using a database filter for `cuid`, enhancing query efficiency and error handling.

- Template serialization now uses the latest version data, improving versioned template data handling.

- Minor formatting, logging, and error message consistency improvements have been made.

These changes streamline custom field handling and enhance organization and template management workflows.
