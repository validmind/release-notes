The update improves the organization template export feature by adding custom fields. When a new organization is created using this template, these custom fields are automatically included, simplifying the setup process for customers. There are no breaking changes with this update.

This update improves custom fields and template processing in organization and inventory model management.

- The `sanitize_custom_fields` method now filters out empty fields, 'null' or 'n/a' values (case insensitive), and values starting with 'err:', ensuring only valid custom field values are included in organization template serialization.

- After setting up a new organization, the system retrieves a user and triggers field update events for custom fields, ensuring proper propagation to related inventory models.

- Inventory models are retrieved using a database filter by `cuid`, streamlining queries and error handling.

- Template serialization uses the latest version data for better handling of versioned template data.

- Minor formatting adjustments and improvements in logging and error message consistency have been implemented.
