You can now export organization templates that include `custom fields`. When you create a new organization from a template, these fields are automatically added. There are no breaking changes.

Now, a `sanitize_custom_fields` method is included in inventory model serialization. This method removes empty values, strings equal to `null` or `n/a` (case-insensitive), and values starting with `err:`. Organization templates now use this sanitizer to ensure only valid custom fields are stored.

When creating an organization, the system now selects a user from that organization and triggers custom-field update events, allowing default or template-defined fields to immediately propagate to related inventory models.

Inventory models are now retrieved using a direct database filter on `cuid`, reducing query overhead and enhancing error handling.

Template serialization now accesses the latest version data, providing you with accurate, version-aware template content.

Logging, formatting, and error messages have been standardized for consistency.
