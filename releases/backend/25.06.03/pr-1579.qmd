<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
INITIAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues in the content include the presence of redundant introductory information between the PR summary and external notes, and references to internal processes that need removal. The external notes are well-structured and provide detailed information about the update, which should be prioritized over the PR summary.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Remove the PR summary entirely as it is redundant. The external notes provide a more comprehensive overview of the update.
2. Remove any references to CI/CD workflows, GitHub Actions, build processes, deployment pipelines, or internal automation from the content. Ensure that these are not present in the external notes.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
No changes needed. The external notes are distinct and provide detailed information about the update, which does not overlap with the PR summary once it is removed.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Simplify the language in the external notes where possible. For example, replace "Numerous documentation improvements" with "Improved documentation."
2. Ensure that the explanations are clear and concise, breaking up any overly long sentences if necessary. However, the current content is already well-structured, so minimal changes are needed here.
