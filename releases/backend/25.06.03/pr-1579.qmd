<!--- DEBUG INFORMATION
QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
ASSESSMENT:
The main issues found in the release notes content include duplication in version headings, lack of user benefit statements, and some clarity issues due to verbose language and technical jargon. The content structure is somewhat disorganized, and there are minor clarity issues that could be improved.

PASS_1_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate version heading "v2.32.4" to streamline the content.
2. Reorganize the "Deprecations" section to clearly distinguish between added and dropped support. Consider rephrasing to: "Support for `pypy 3.11` added for Linux and macOS. Support for `pypy 3.9` dropped following its end of support."
3. Add a brief user benefit statement to the "Security" section to clarify the impact of the CVE fix. For example, "This update enhances security by ensuring credentials are retrieved correctly."
4. Ensure that each section starts with a clear explanation of its purpose to improve readability.

PASS_2_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Remove the redundant version heading "v2.32.4" to eliminate duplication with "2.32.4 (2025-06-10)".
2. Ensure that the PR Summary and External Notes do not repeat the same information unnecessarily. If the PR Summary is covered in the External Notes, consider removing it or rephrasing to highlight unique aspects.

PASS_3_INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Simplify the language in the "Security" section by breaking down complex sentences. For example, rephrase "CVE-2024-47081 Fixed an issue where a maliciously crafted URL and trusted environment will retrieve credentials for the wrong hostname/machine from a netrc file" to "Fixed a security issue (CVE-2024-47081) where a crafted URL could incorrectly retrieve credentials."
2. Use simpler language in the "Improvements" section, such as rephrasing "Numerous documentation improvements" to "Improved documentation for clarity and accuracy."
3. Avoid technical jargon where possible, and provide brief explanations for terms like "netrc file" if they are essential to understanding the content.
