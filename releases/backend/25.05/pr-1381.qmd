This update enhances authorization for the report generation endpoint in the UI reporting route. Key changes include:

- The authorization decorator on the GET endpoint now uses a generic `read` action instead of `download_report`.
- Permission checks within the method depend on the document type in the request:
  - `download_doc` authorization is needed for `documentation-report` or `monitoring-report`.
  - `download_vr` authorization is needed for `validation-report`.
  - A `BadRequestError` is raised for unsupported document types.
