#### What
Increases database connection pool default size and upper limit

#### Release Notes
Two new environment variables are available to the API server:

SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE

Defaults to 25, 15 respectively. These are passed directly to `app.config` and used by flask-sqlalchemy.

# PR Summary

This PR introduces configurable settings for the SQLAlchemy connection pool in the Flask backend API. Two new configuration parameters, SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE and SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW, are set via environment variables with default values of 25 and 15 respectively. This allows operators to dynamically adjust the connection pool settings based on deployment needs without modifying the source code.

By leveraging environment variables, the implementation enhances flexibility for managing database connections, particularly under varied load conditions. If the environment variables are not present, the system uses the provided defaults, ensuring continuity in functionality.
