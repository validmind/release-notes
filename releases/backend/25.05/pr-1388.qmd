The default size and upper limit of the database connection pool have been increased. Two new environment variables for the API server, `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` and `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE`, are introduced with default values of 25 and 15, respectively. These variables are used by Flask-SQLAlchemy through `app.config`.

Configurable settings for the SQLAlchemy connection pool in the Flask backend API are now available. The parameters `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE` and `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` can be set via environment variables, with default values of 25 and 15. This allows operators to adjust connection pool settings dynamically based on deployment needs without modifying the source code. Using environment variables enhances flexibility in managing database connections under varied load conditions. If not set, the system defaults to the provided values, ensuring continuity in functionality.
