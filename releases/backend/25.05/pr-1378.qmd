This PR updates the `README.md` file to include instructions for configuring Docker Desktop. It guides users on setting the swap memory to 2GB via the Docker Desktop settings under the Resources tab. This change helps optimize Docker's performance by ensuring appropriate swap settings are in place before starting the project.
