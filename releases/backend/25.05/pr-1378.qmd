# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content improves the original by adding backticks around "readme," which is a common convention to denote code or file names, enhancing clarity. Additionally, capitalizing "Docker" aligns with the proper noun usage for the software's name. Overall, the edits improve readability and accuracy.
