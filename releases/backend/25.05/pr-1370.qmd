This update enhances the AWS secondary deployment workflow by introducing a dynamic Dockerfile specification. The `file: ${{ matrix.file }}` parameter in the `docker/build-push-action` step enables the workflow to select the appropriate Dockerfile based on the matrix configuration. This change increases build process flexibility by supporting multiple Dockerfiles without needing workflow modifications for each scenario.
