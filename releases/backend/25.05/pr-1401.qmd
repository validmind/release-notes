# PR Summary

This PR updates the GitHub Actions deployment workflow by modifying the file templating process for Kubernetes manifests. The change involves replacing the source file for generating the values.yaml file from the old template (values.yaml) to a new template file (values-new.yaml). This adjustment is expected to incorporate updated configuration values and align with new deployment parameters.

The rest of the substitutions performed using sed remain unchanged, ensuring that tokens such as the site, environment, vault ID, repository, and API SHA are correctly replaced in the templated file.
