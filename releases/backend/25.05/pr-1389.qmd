# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content effectively improves the original by capitalizing the first letter, which is standard for titles or headings. It also uses backticks around "db," which is a common convention to denote code or technical terms, enhancing clarity for readers familiar with programming or database management. Overall, the edit maintains the original meaning while presenting it in a more polished and professional manner.

# PR Summary

This PR enhances the backend API configuration by introducing environment-based settings for SQLAlchemy's connection pooling. The Flask app now retrieves the values for SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE and SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW from environment variables, defaulting to 25 and 15 respectively when the variables are not set. This improvement enables dynamic tuning of database connection pooling, which can optimize performance and resource usage in different deployment scenarios.
