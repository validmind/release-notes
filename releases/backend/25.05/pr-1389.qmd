This update improves the backend API configuration by adding environment-based settings for SQLAlchemy's connection pooling. The Flask app now uses environment variables to set `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE` and `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW`, defaulting to 25 and 15 if not specified. This allows for dynamic adjustment of database connection pooling, optimizing performance and resource usage across various deployment scenarios.
