This update enhances metadata filtering in the `get_latest_figures` function by adding special handling for timestamp values. It checks if the metadata value is a `datetime` or `date` object. If so, the JSON string value is cast to a datetime type using SQLAlchemy's `func.cast` for comparison. Otherwise, the value is converted to a string. This ensures accurate filtering of records based on timestamp metadata, allowing date and time values to be correctly interpreted and compared within the query.
