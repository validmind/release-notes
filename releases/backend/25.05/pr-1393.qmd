# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear improvement over the original. By enclosing "Figure" in backticks, it indicates that "Figure" is likely a class or model name in a programming context, which helps clarify the meaning for readers familiar with coding conventions. The rest of the sentence remains unchanged, as it was already clear and concise. Overall, the edit enhances readability and understanding without altering the original intent.

# PR Summary

This pull request enhances the metadata filtering in the `get_latest_figures` function by adding special handling for timestamp values. The changes introduce a check to determine if the metadata value is a `datetime` or `date` object. If it is, the code casts the JSON string value to a datetime type using SQLAlchemy's `func.cast` and compares it with the provided value. If not, the value is converted to a string for comparison. This improvement allows for accurate filtering of records based on timestamp metadata, ensuring that date and time values are correctly interpreted and compared within the query.
