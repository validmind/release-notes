This update improves metadata filtering in the `get_latest_figures` function by handling timestamp values. It checks if the metadata value is a `datetime` or `date` object. If it is, the JSON string value is cast to a datetime type using SQLAlchemy's `func.cast` for comparison. Otherwise, it is converted to a string. This ensures accurate filtering of records based on timestamp metadata, allowing date and time values to be correctly interpreted within the query.
