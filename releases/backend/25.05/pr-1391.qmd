Refactored API initialization and logging to reduce noise.

- Consolidated imports, reordered error-handler registration, and initialized context earlier in `src/backend/api.py`.
- Registered routes for diagnostics, organizations, RBAC, scrubbers, settings, users, approvals, assessment options, assets proxy, attestations, block library, guidelines, and model page layouts.
- Suppressed `/api/v1/health` messages from `werkzeug`; this endpoint now logs at the debug level, while other routes log at the info level.
