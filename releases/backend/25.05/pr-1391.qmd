This update refactors API initialization and logging to improve maintainability and reduce log noise. In `src/backend/api.py`, import organization has been improved, and new route registrations have been added for various admin and UI endpoints. Error handler registration and context setup have been streamlined. A lambda filter on the Werkzeug logger now filters out health check requests. In `src/backend/utils/logging/structlog.py`, request logging for the `/api/v1/health` endpoint is now at the debug level, reducing log clutter. These changes enhance code clarity and logging efficiency without affecting core API functionality.
