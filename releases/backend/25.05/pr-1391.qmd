# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is a clear and concise improvement over the original. It replaces "prod" with "production," which is more formal and clear. Additionally, it specifies that the logging is related to an "endpoint," which provides more context. The use of backticks around `/api/v1/health` is a nice touch, as it highlights the endpoint, making it stand out as a code reference. Overall, the edited content effectively communicates the intended message with improved clarity and professionalism.

# PR Summary

This PR refactors the API initialization and logging configuration to improve maintainability and reduce log noise. Major changes include:

- In src/backend/api.py:
  - Improved import organization by removing duplicates and reordering modules for clarity.
  - Added new route registrations for several admin and UI endpoints (e.g., diagnostics, organizations, RBAC, scrubbers, settings, users, approvals, assessment options, assets proxy, attestations, block library, guidelines, model page layouts, etc.), ensuring a more structured configuration of the API.
  - Adjusted error handler registration and context setup to streamline the initialization sequence.
  - Introduced a lambda filter on the werkzeug logger to filter out health check requests from noisy logging.

- In src/backend/utils/logging/structlog.py:
  - Modified the request logging behavior to log the '/api/v1/health' endpoint at debug level while keeping info level logging for other endpoints. This helps reduce clutter in the logs from frequent health check pings.

Overall, the changes aim to enhance code clarity, maintainability, and logging efficiency without impacting the core functionality of the API.
