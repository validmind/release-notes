This update enhances API initialization and logging configuration for improved maintainability and reduced log noise. In `src/backend/api.py`, imports are refined by removing duplicates and reordering modules. New route registrations are added for various admin and UI endpoints. Error handler registration and context setup are streamlined. A lambda filter on the `werkzeug` logger now filters out health check requests. In `src/backend/utils/logging/structlog.py`, request logging for the `/api/v1/health` endpoint is set to debug level, reducing log clutter. These changes improve code clarity and logging efficiency without affecting API functionality.
