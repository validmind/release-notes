Refactor API initialization and logging to enhance maintainability and reduce log noise.

- Reorganized imports.

- Registered routes for `diagnostics`, `organizations`, `RBAC`, `scrubbers`, `settings`, `users`, `approvals`, `assessment options`, `assets proxy`, `attestations`, `block library`, `guidelines`, and `model page layouts`.

- Streamlined error handler setup and context initialization.

- Added a `werkzeug` logging filter; `/api/v1/health` now logs at the debug level, while all other endpoints log at the info level.
