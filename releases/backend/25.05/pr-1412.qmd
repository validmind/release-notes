This update improves the `_add_library_block` function by adding a `content_type` parameter, derived from `document_type`, to the function call. Previously, the function only used `data["content"]["content_type"]`. By including `document_type`, the function can now provide a more accurate or context-specific content type when adding blocks to a template. This ensures the block includes both the original content information and the explicit document type, allowing for different rendering or processing based on its type.
