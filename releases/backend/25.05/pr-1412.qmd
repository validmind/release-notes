# PR Summary

This PR introduces a functional enhancement to the `_add_library_block` function by passing an additional `content_type` parameter derived from `document_type` to the function call. Previously, the function was relying solely on the internal `data["content"]["content_type"]`, but now it also incorporates the externally provided `document_type` value, potentially giving a more accurate or context-specific content type when adding blocks to a template.

The change ensures that the block created incorporates both the original content information and the explicit document type, which might be used for rendering or processing the block differently based on its type.
