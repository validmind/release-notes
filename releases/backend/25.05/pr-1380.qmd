This update enhances the UI reporting endpoint by refining the authorization logic for report generation.

- Top-level authorization now uses the generic action `read`.
  
- Fine-grained authorization depends on document type. "Documentation-report" and "monitoring-report" require the `download_doc` permission, while "validation-report" needs the `download_vr` permission.

- An invalid document type triggers a `BadRequestError`.

- Exception handling is improved to specifically catch `BadRequestError` and manage other exceptions effectively.
