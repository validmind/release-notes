# PR Summary

This PR updates the UI reporting endpoint related to report generation. The key functional change is in the authorization logic for generating different types of reports. Previously, the endpoint applied a generic authorization check for downloading reports. With these changes:

- The top-level authorization decorator is now set to the generic action "read" rather than "download_report".

- Fine-grained authorization is enforced inside the method based on the specific document type. For document types "documentation-report" and "monitoring-report", the endpoint explicitly checks for the "download_doc" permission. For document type "validation-report", it checks for the "download_vr" permission.

- If the document type provided does not match any of the expected values, the system raises a BadRequestError, ensuring only valid report types are processed.

- The exception handling is updated to catch and pass-through the BadRequestError separately, while still handling other exceptions appropriately.
