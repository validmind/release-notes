This update refines the UI reporting endpoint for report generation, focusing on authorization logic for various report types. Key changes include:

- The top-level authorization now uses the generic action `read` instead of `download_report`.
  
- Fine-grained authorization is applied based on document type: "documentation-report" and "monitoring-report" require `download_doc` permission, while "validation-report" requires `download_vr` permission.

- A `BadRequestError` is raised for invalid document types, ensuring only valid reports are processed.

- Exception handling is improved to specifically manage `BadRequestError` separately from other exceptions.
