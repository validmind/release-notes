# PR Summary

This pull request introduces enhancements to the user settings by adding a new locale configuration field. Key changes include:

1. Database Migration:
   - A new Alembic migration is added to update the default value of the `ui_settings` column in the `users` table, setting it to `{"locale": "en"}` for future inserts.
   - The migration updates existing records to include the locale setting if it is missing, ensuring that all users have a default locale value.
   - A downgrade path is provided to revert the default back to an empty JSON object if needed.

2. Application Code Update:
   - The `ui_settings` column in the User model is modified to use `{"locale": "en"}` as its default value.
   - The JSON schema used for validating `ui_settings` is updated to include a new property `locale` of type string, ensuring that the field conforms to the expected format.

These changes ensure a consistent handling of locale configurations throughout the system and improve the robustness of user settings management.
