This update enhances user settings by adding a locale configuration field. Key changes include:

- A new Alembic migration sets the default value of the `ui_settings` column in the `users` table to `{"locale": "en"}` for future inserts and updates existing records to include the locale setting if missing.
- The `ui_settings` column in the User model now defaults to `{"locale": "en"}`.
- The JSON schema for `ui_settings` is updated to include a `locale` property of type string.
