This update enhances user settings by adding a new locale configuration field. 

- **Database Migration:**
  
  - A new Alembic migration sets the default value of the `ui_settings` column in the `users` table to `{"locale": "en"}` for future entries.
  
  - Existing records are updated to include the locale setting if missing, ensuring all users have a default locale.
  
  - A downgrade option is available to revert the default to an empty JSON object if necessary.

- **Application Code Update:**
  
  - The `ui_settings` column in the User model now defaults to `{"locale": "en"}`.
  
  - The JSON schema for `ui_settings` is updated to include a `locale` property of type string, ensuring proper format.

These changes ensure consistent locale configuration handling and improve user settings management.
