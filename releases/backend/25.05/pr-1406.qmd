This update enhances dependency management and consistency in container builds. The Dockerfile now uses base image v1.67.4 and upgrades `h11` to version 0.16.0, improving HTTP/1.1 implementation for customer-managed deployments. The `poetry.lock` file reflects the upgrade of `h11` from 0.14.0 to 0.16.0 and `httpcore` from 1.0.7 to 1.0.9. The `pyproject.toml` file now enforces `h11` (>=0.16.0) for consistent builds and dependency resolution.
