This PR upgrades key dependencies and ensures consistency in container builds. Key changes include updating the `Dockerfile` to use a newer base image (v1.67.4) and upgrading `h11` to version 0.16.0 for improved HTTP/1.1 compatibility. The `poetry.lock` file reflects the `h11` upgrade from 0.14.0 to 0.16.0 and updates `httpcore` from 1.0.7 to 1.0.9. The `pyproject.toml` file now enforces `h11` version 0.16.0 or higher. These updates enhance library management and system security.

- Updated the `Dockerfile` to use a newer base image (v1.67.4) and added a command to upgrade `h11` to version 0.16.0, ensuring the HTTP/1.1 implementation is current and compatible.

- In the `Dockerfile` for customer-managed deployments, the `h11` upgrade to 0.16.0 is added, aligning both Docker configurations.

- The `poetry.lock` file has been updated to reflect the upgrade of the `h11` package from version 0.14.0 to 0.16.0. Additionally, `httpcore` has been updated from version 1.0.7 to 1.0.9, with corresponding changes to dependency specifications.

- The `pyproject.toml` file now includes a dependency constraint for `h11` (>=0.16.0) to enforce consistency across builds and dependency resolution.

Overall, these changes streamline library dependency management and improve consistency in both Docker environments and Python package management, ensuring the system operates with more recent and secure versions of key libraries.
