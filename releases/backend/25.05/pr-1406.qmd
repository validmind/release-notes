# PR Summary

This PR primarily focuses on upgrading key dependencies and ensuring consistency in container builds. The main changes are:

- Updated the Dockerfile to use a newer base image (v1.67.4 instead of v1.63.14) and added a command to upgrade h11 to version 0.16.0. This ensures that the HTTP/1.1 implementation is up-to-date and compatible with current requirements.

- In the Dockerfile for customer-managed deployments, the h11 upgrade to 0.16.0 is added, ensuring both Docker configurations are aligned.

- The poetry.lock file has been updated to reflect the upgrade of the h11 package from version 0.14.0 to 0.16.0. Additionally, httpcore has been updated from version 1.0.7 to 1.0.9, along with corresponding changes to the dependency specifications.

- The pyproject.toml file now includes a dependency constraint for h11 (>=0.16.0) to enforce consistency across builds and dependency resolution.

Overall, these changes streamline library dependency management and improve consistency in both the Docker environments and Python package management, ensuring that the system operates with more recent and secure versions of key libraries.
