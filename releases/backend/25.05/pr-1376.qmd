This update enhances the inventory model API by adding two new fields: `updated_at` and `documentation_updated_at`. These fields help track when models and their documentation are updated. The GET endpoint now supports sorting by `documentation_updated_at`, using a correlated subquery to find the latest documentation update time for events with `target_type` set to "ModelDocument". This allows clients to order models more accurately based on documentation updates.
