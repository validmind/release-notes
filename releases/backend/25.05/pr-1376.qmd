# PR Summary

This PR introduces functional enhancements to the inventory model API. The changes include:

1. Adding two new fields, `updated_at` and `documentation_updated_at`, to the inventory model schema. This enables tracking of when the models and their associated documentation are updated.

2. Updating the GET endpoint for inventory models to allow sorting by the `documentation_updated_at` field. When this sort parameter is used, the query joins the `Event` table and uses a correlated subquery to determine the most recent update time for model documentation (i.e., events with `target_type` set to "ModelDocument").

These changes enhance usability by allowing clients to more precisely order models based on documentation updates.
