This update enhances template handling within the application by introducing several improvements:

- The `upsert` function in the installation script now includes a `template_type` parameter to better distinguish templates.

- Validation functions have been added to backend database models for templates and template versions. These functions ensure proper processing of template data using the new `flatten_sections` utility, which converts nested sections into a flat JSON-safe format.

- Two new utility functions, `extract_clean_section` and `flatten_sections`, have been implemented. They recursively clean and flatten nested sections by removing unwanted keys like `order`, `index`, and `sections`, facilitating easier storage and processing of template metadata.

- Unit tests have been expanded to cover the new flattening functionality. These tests confirm correct flattening of nested sections, handle cases with missing `sections` keys, and manage deeply nested structures. They also ensure that existing functionalities, such as template serialization, adapt to the updated structure, using `sections` instead of `pages`.
