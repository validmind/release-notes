This pull request updates the deployment workflow configurations for AWS secondary, production, and staging environments. The workflows now copy the new template file (`values-new.yaml`) into the manifests directory instead of the old template file (`values.yaml`). The `sed` commands for template substitutions remain unchanged. This change ensures deployments use the updated configuration template for newer deployment requirements.
