The `werkzeug` dependency version in the `pyproject.toml` file has been updated from `^2.3.0` to `^3.0.6`. This change may bring bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features. Users should verify that this update does not affect any application components relying on `werkzeug`, especially in areas like routing, request handling, or middleware integration.
