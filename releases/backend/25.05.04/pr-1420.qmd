This update modifies the Dockerfile for the customer-managed environment by removing the `poetry.lock` file from the application directory during the container build process. This change prevents issues with dependency resolution or outdated locks in the container, ensuring clean dependency management. By explicitly removing the file, the integrity of the container build is maintained, allowing the project to generate an updated lock file in subsequent steps or during runtime.
