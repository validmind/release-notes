# PR Summary

This PR introduces a change in the Dockerfile for the customer-managed environment. The update removes the poetry.lock file from the application directory during the container build process. This change likely aims to prevent issues related to dependency resolution or outdated locks from being shipped in the container, ensuring that the environment is set up with clean dependency management.

The change is focused on an explicit file removal operation, preserving the integrity of the container build while potentially allowing the project to generate an updated lock file in subsequent steps or during runtime.
