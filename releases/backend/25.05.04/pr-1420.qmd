This update modifies the Dockerfile for the customer-managed environment by removing the `poetry.lock` file from the application directory during the container build process. This change prevents issues with dependency resolution or outdated locks being included in the container. It ensures clean dependency management by explicitly removing the file, allowing the project to generate an updated lock file in later steps or during runtime.
