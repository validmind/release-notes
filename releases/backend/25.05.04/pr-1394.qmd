# PR Summary

This pull request introduces extensive refactoring of import statements and code formatting adjustments across the project. The changes include reordering and grouping of imports in source code, migration scripts, and utility modules; moving some imports to better reflect dependency needs; and switching the code formatting tool in the Makefile from Black to Ruff. These updates help enforce consistent style guidelines, resolve potential circular dependencies, and improve readability. In addition, minor whitespace and line-break adjustments have been applied in various files, including API handlers, service modules, and tests. Functionality remains unchanged, while the maintainability and clarity of the code has been enhanced significantly.

Key functional changes:
- Standardized and reorganized import ordering in multiple files (e.g., migration scripts, API modules, and utility scripts).
- Updated the Makefile to run Ruff for both formatting and linting, improving style enforcement.
- Cleaned up redundant whitespace and adjusted formatting for inline strings and dictionary keys without altering program logic.

Overall, these improvements aim to streamline the codebase, making future maintenance easier and reducing the risk of dependency issues without affecting business logic.
