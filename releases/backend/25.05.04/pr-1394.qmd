This update involves a comprehensive refactoring of import statements and code formatting across the project. Import statements in source code, migration scripts, and utility modules have been reordered and grouped to better reflect dependencies. The code formatting tool in the `Makefile` has been switched from Black to Ruff, enhancing style consistency and readability. Minor whitespace and line-break adjustments were made in various files, including API handlers and tests. While functionality remains unchanged, the maintainability and clarity of the code have been significantly improved.

Key functional changes:

- Standardized and reorganized import ordering in multiple files, such as migration scripts, API modules, and utility scripts.
- Updated the `Makefile` to run Ruff for both formatting and linting, improving style enforcement.
- Cleaned up redundant whitespace and adjusted formatting for inline strings and dictionary keys without altering program logic.

Overall, these improvements aim to streamline the codebase, making future maintenance easier and reducing the risk of dependency issues without affecting business logic.
