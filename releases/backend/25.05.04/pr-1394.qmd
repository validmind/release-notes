This update involves extensive refactoring of import statements and code formatting across the project. Import statements in source code, migration scripts, and utility modules have been reordered and grouped to better reflect dependencies. The code formatting tool in the `Makefile` has been switched from Black to Ruff, enhancing style consistency and readability. Minor whitespace and line-break adjustments have been made in various files, including API handlers and tests. These changes improve maintainability and clarity without altering functionality.

Key changes include standardized import ordering in multiple files and updating the `Makefile` to use Ruff for formatting and linting. Redundant whitespace has been removed, and formatting for inline strings and dictionary keys has been refined. These improvements streamline the codebase, facilitating easier future maintenance and reducing dependency issues without affecting business logic.
