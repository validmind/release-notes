This update introduces an extension for profiling, enhancing performance analysis capabilities.

This update introduces a migration script to manage the `pg_stat_statements` extension in a PostgreSQL database. The script checks for the extension's existence and creates it if absent. The upgrade function connects to the database, verifies the extension's presence, and conditionally creates it if needed. It also retrieves and displays the current version of the extension. The downgrade function is a placeholder without rollback logic. These changes ensure `pg_stat_statements` is available without duplication.
