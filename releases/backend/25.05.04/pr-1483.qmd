An extension for profiling has been added.

This update adds a migration script to manage the `pg_stat_statements` extension in a PostgreSQL database. The script checks for the extension's existence and creates it if absent. The upgrade function connects to the database, verifies the extension's installation, and conditionally creates it if needed. It also retrieves and displays the current version for information. The downgrade function is a placeholder with no rollback logic. These changes ensure the monitoring features of `pg_stat_statements` are available without duplication.
