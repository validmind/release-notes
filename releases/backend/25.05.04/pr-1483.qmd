An extension has been added for profiling.

This update introduces a migration script to manage the `pg_stat_statements` extension in a PostgreSQL database. The script checks for the extension's existence and creates it if absent. The upgrade function connects to the database, verifies the extension's installation, and conditionally creates it if missing. It then retrieves and prints the current version for information. The downgrade function is a placeholder with no rollback logic. These changes ensure monitoring features are available without duplicating the extension.
