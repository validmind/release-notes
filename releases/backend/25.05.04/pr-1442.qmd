This update enhances system performance by increasing worker concurrency. This change allows for more tasks to be processed simultaneously, improving overall efficiency and speed.

This pull request increases the Celery worker concurrency from 4 to 6 in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` file. This change enables the worker to handle more tasks simultaneously, potentially enhancing performance under load. The rest of the command remains unchanged, ensuring the worker starts with the correct working directory and Celery application context.
