This update enhances error handling during the initial onboarding process. Previously, selecting a weak password resulted in a 500 error without explanation. Now, users receive a clear error message from Auth0, improving the onboarding experience.

Bugfix: Improved error handling in the organization onboarding flow.

This PR introduces several functional improvements, focusing on debugging, authentication error handling, code enhancements, and unit testing. A new remote debugging configuration for VS Code allows attaching a debugger to the API service in Docker. Authentication error handling now checks for password strength errors, raising specific error codes. Code enhancements include improved JSON serialization and logging updates. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests for `Auth0AuthProvider` have been added.

- **Debugging Enhancements:**
  
  - A remote debugging configuration is added to the VS Code launch file (`.vscode/launch.json`) for attaching a debugger (`debugpy`) to the API service in Docker. The README includes instructions for interactive debugging.
  
  - Docker Compose now exposes port 5678 and mounts relevant backend volumes, improving the debugging experience in a containerized environment.
  
  - The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script launches the Python application with `debugpy` (`-m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678`), enabling remote debugging.

- **Auth Error Handling Improvements:**
  
  - Enhanced error handling in `src/backend/auth/auth_provider.py` checks for password strength errors. A `PasswordStrengthError` in the API response raises an error with an `INVALID_FIELD` code and detailed information. Other errors default to a generic unauthorized error.
  
  - Route handling in `src/backend/routes/admin/organizations.py` is updated to catch and re-raise `AuthError`, ensuring proper error handling by the calling context.

- **Code and Utility Enhancements:**
  
  - The JSON encoder (`src/backend/utils/__init__.py`) now handles objects with a `to_dict` method, improving custom object serialization.
  
  - Logging in the generic error handler (`src/backend/errors/handlers.py`) is updated from exception level to error level to reduce excessive stack traces for expected issues.

- **Extended Unit Tests:**
  
  - A comprehensive set of unit tests for `Auth0AuthProvider` is added in `tests/unit/test_auth0_provider.py`. These tests cover scenarios like handling weak passwords, successful user creation, and other error cases, using mocks to simulate API interactions and validate error signaling and token management.
