This update enhances the onboarding process for new organizations by providing clear error messages when a weak password is selected during setup, addressing previous backend errors without explanation. Additionally, developers working with the API container can now attach Cursor to the local API container, set debug breakpoints, and benefit from automatic code reloading during editing, eliminating the need for restarts and improving development efficiency.

This PR introduces several functional improvements:

- **Debugging Enhancements**: A new remote debugging configuration has been added to the VS Code launch file (`.vscode/launch.json`) for attaching a debugger via `debugpy` to the API service running in Docker. The README provides instructions for interactive debugging. The Docker Compose configuration now exposes port 5678 and mounts relevant backend volumes, enhancing the debugging experience. The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script launches the Python application with `debugpy` using the `-m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678` flag.

- **Auth Error Handling Improvements**: Error handling in the authentication provider code (`src/backend/auth/auth_provider.py`) has been improved to check for password strength errors. When a `PasswordStrengthError` is detected in the API response, an error is raised with a new `INVALID_FIELD` code and detailed error information. Otherwise, a generic unauthorized error is raised. The route handling in `src/backend/routes/admin/organizations.py` has been updated to catch and re-raise `AuthError`.

- **Code and Utility Enhancements**: The JSON encoder (`src/backend/utils/__init__.py`) now handles objects with a `to_dict` method, improving custom object serialization. Logging in the generic error handler (`src/backend/errors/handlers.py`) has been updated from exception level to error level to prevent excessive stack traces for expected issues.

- **Extended Unit Tests**: A comprehensive set of unit tests for `Auth0AuthProvider` has been added in `tests/unit/test_auth0_provider.py`. These tests cover scenarios like handling weak passwords, successful user creation, and other error cases. Mocks simulate API interactions to validate correct error signaling and token management.
