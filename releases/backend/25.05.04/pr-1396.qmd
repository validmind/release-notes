This update enhances the initial onboarding process by displaying helpful error messages from Auth0 when a weak password is chosen, addressing a previous issue where users received a backend error without explanation. 

Bugfix: Improved error handling in the organization onboarding flow.

This update introduces several functional improvements, including enhanced debugging capabilities, improved error handling for authentication, code and utility enhancements, and extended unit tests.

- **Debugging Enhancements**: A new remote debugging configuration has been added to the VS Code launch file (`.vscode/launch.json`). This allows users to attach a debugger via `debugpy` to the API service running in Docker. The README now includes instructions for using this configuration. The Docker Compose setup has been updated to expose port 5678 and mount relevant volumes from the backend, improving the debugging experience in a containerized environment. The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script now launches the Python application with `debugpy` using the `-m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678` flag for remote debugging.

- **Auth Error Handling Improvements**: Error handling in the authentication provider code (`src/backend/auth/auth_provider.py`) now checks for password strength errors. When a `PasswordStrengthError` is detected in the API response, an error is raised with a new `INVALID_FIELD` code and detailed error information. Otherwise, it defaults to a generic unauthorized error. The route handling in `src/backend/routes/admin/organizations.py` has been updated to catch and re-raise `AuthError`, ensuring these errors are managed appropriately by the calling context.

- **Code and Utility Enhancements**: The JSON encoder (`src/backend/utils/__init__.py`) now handles objects implementing a `to_dict` method, improving custom object serialization. Logging in the generic error handler (`src/backend/errors/handlers.py`) has been updated from exception level to error level to prevent excessive stack traces for expected issues.

- **Extended Unit Tests**: A comprehensive set of unit tests for `Auth0AuthProvider` has been added in `tests/unit/test_auth0_provider.py`. These tests cover scenarios such as handling weak passwords, successful user creation, and other error cases. The tests use mocks to simulate API interactions and validate correct error signaling and token management.
