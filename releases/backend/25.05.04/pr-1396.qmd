#### Why
When setting up the initial onboarding if a weak password is chosen then the backend throws a 500 error with no explanation. Auth0 does give a helpful error message, but it is thrown away.

After this PR, at least one helpful message from Auth0 is presented to the user in a helpful manner.

#### Release Notes
Bugfix: Organization on-boarding flow error handling improvements

# PR Summary

This PR introduces several functional improvements:

1. Debugging Enhancements:
   - A new remote debugging configuration is added to the VS Code launch file (`.vscode/launch.json`) to allow attaching a debugger (via `debugpy`) to the API service running in Docker. This is complemented by updates in the README which now describes how to use this configuration for interactive debugging.
   - The Docker Compose configuration is updated to expose port 5678 and mount relevant volumes from the backend, enabling a smoother debugging experience in a containerized environment.
   - The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script has been modified to launch the Python application with `debugpy` (using the `-m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678` flag) which facilitates remote debugging.

2. Auth Error Handling Improvements:
   - In the authentication provider code (`src/backend/auth/auth_provider.py`), enhanced error handling now checks for password strength errors. When a 'PasswordStrengthError' is detected in the API response, an error is raised with a new `INVALID_FIELD` code along with detailed error information. In other cases, it falls back to a generic unauthorized error.
   - Additionally, the route handling in `src/backend/routes/admin/organizations.py` has been updated to specifically catch and re-raise `AuthError`, ensuring that such errors are handled appropriately by the calling context.

3. Code and Utility Enhancements:
   - In the JSON encoder (`src/backend/utils/__init__.py`), a new case has been added to properly handle objects that implement a `to_dict` method, improving the serialization of custom objects.
   - Logging in the generic error handler (`src/backend/errors/handlers.py`) has been updated from exception level logging to error level logging to avoid excessive stack traces for expected issues.

4. Extended Unit Tests:
   - A comprehensive new set of unit tests for `Auth0AuthProvider` has been added in `tests/unit/test_auth0_provider.py`. These tests cover scenarios including handling weak passwords, successful user creation, and other error cases. The tests use mocks to simulate API interactions and validate correct error signaling and token management.
