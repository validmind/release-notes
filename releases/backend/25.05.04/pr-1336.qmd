This update to the Keycloak service configuration includes two key changes. First, volume mounts for configuration files like `realm-export.json`, themes, and `entrypoint.sh` have been removed from the `docker-compose` file. These files are now directly copied into the Docker image via the `Dockerfile`, simplifying deployment. Second, the environment variable `KC_DB_DATABASE` has been changed to `KC_DB_DtATABASE`. Verify this change to ensure it aligns with downstream components. Overall, the update embeds configuration files within the image, reducing dependency on host-based volume mounts.
