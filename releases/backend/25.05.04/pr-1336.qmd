This update enhances the Keycloak service configuration by embedding configuration files directly into the Docker image, eliminating the need for volume mounts in the `docker-compose` file. Additionally, the environment variable `KC_DB_DATABASE` has been changed to `KC_DB_DtATABASE`. Verify this change to ensure compatibility with downstream components. These modifications streamline deployment but require attention to the environment variable adjustment to avoid issues.

This pull request introduces two main changes to the Keycloak service configuration:

- The volume mounts for Keycloak configuration files (`realm-export.json`, themes, and `entrypoint.sh`) in the `docker-compose` file have been removed. These files are now incorporated directly into the Docker image through updates in the `Dockerfile`. This change is intended to streamline deployment by including the necessary assets during the image build process.

- An environment variable has been modified from `KC_DB_DATABASE` to `KC_DB_DtATABASE`. It is important to verify whether this change is intentional or a typo, and ensure that the new variable name aligns with the expected configuration in downstream components.

Overall, this update improves the deployment process by embedding configuration files within the image, thereby reducing the reliance on host-based volume mounts. However, care should be taken with the environment variable change to prevent any potential issues.
