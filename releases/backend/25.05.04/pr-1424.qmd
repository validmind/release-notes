# PR Summary

This pull request introduces several enhancements focused on improving code formatting consistency and cleaning up lint exception comments. The changes include:

- Updating the Makefile to run ruff commands with the `--no-cache` option. This ensures that the latest code analysis is used without cached results, potentially catching new issues more reliably.

- Modifying various migration scripts by removing the verbose `# noqa: B950` markers and replacing them with a shorter `# noqa`. This simplifies the code without affecting the intended lint suppression.

- Reordering some import statements in a couple of modules to improve consistency and possibly resolve minor dependency ordering issues.

- Adjusting a test in the object storage service to use the same simplified `# noqa` format for the KMS key configuration string.

Overall, the functionality remains unchanged, with the primary impact being on code formatting and clarity.
