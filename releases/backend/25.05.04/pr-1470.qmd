The API route `/api/v1/workflows/targets/{cuid}/executions` has been updated to improve data selection accuracy. Previously, `Workflow.get_workflow` included the user and workflows within the user's organization, but `Execution.get_by_target` selected executions by target from all organizations. Now, `Execution.get_by_target` also includes the user, ensuring it selects executions by target only from the user's organization.

This update refactors workflow retrieval methods to focus on the associated organization rather than the user object. Key changes include updating the `get_workflow` method to require an organization and a CUID, enhancing the `get_by_target` method to filter queries by organization, and modifying REST API endpoints to align with these changes. Unit tests have been adjusted to ensure consistency. These improvements centralize organization-level access, enhancing consistency and reducing potential mismatches.

- In `src/backend/db/workflow.py`, the `get_workflow` method now requires an organization and a CUID. It raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if the organization is not provided.

- The `get_by_target` method now accepts an organization parameter and filters queries based on the organization associated with the workflow, ensuring correct scoping by organization.

- In `src/backend/routes/ui_workflows.py`, REST API endpoints now pass `g.current_user_org` instead of `g.current_user` to `Workflow.get_workflow`, aligning data retrieval with the new workflow model.

- Unit tests in `tests/unit/test_workflows.py` have been updated to use the organization parameter when fetching workflows and testing execution queries, ensuring consistency throughout the project.
