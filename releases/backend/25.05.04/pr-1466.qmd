This update refines the API endpoint's handling of the `contents` field in UI inventory models. Previously, if a section lacked a `contents` key, the code defaulted to a list with a dictionary containing a `content_id` (set to the section ID) and a `content_type` of `text`. Now, the `get()` method retrieves `contents`, defaulting to an empty list if absent. This change is applied consistently across endpoints, reducing code complexity and clarifying behavior. Users should ensure this does not cause unintended effects.
