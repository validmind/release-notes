This update refactors the API endpoint's handling of the `contents` field in UI inventory models. Previously, if a section lacked a `contents` key, the code defaulted to a list with a dictionary containing a `content_id` (set to the section ID) and a `content_type` of `text`. The new logic uses the dictionary `get()` method to retrieve `contents`, defaulting to an empty list if absent. This change is applied consistently across endpoints processing section data.

This simplification reduces unnecessary code and clarifies expected behavior when `contents` is missing. API users should ensure that returning an empty list, instead of a default content block, does not cause unintended effects.
