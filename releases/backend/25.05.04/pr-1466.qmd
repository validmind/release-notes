This update refactors the API endpoint handling of the `contents` field in UI inventory models. Previously, if a section lacked a `contents` key, it defaulted to a list containing a dictionary with a `content_id` (matching the section ID) and a `content_type` of `text`. Now, the `get()` method retrieves `contents`, defaulting to an empty list if absent. This change simplifies the code and clarifies behavior. Users should ensure that returning an empty list does not cause unintended effects.
