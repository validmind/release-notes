This update introduces two key changes to the Keycloak realm configuration and templates. First, self-registration is disabled by setting the `registrationAllowed` flag to false, preventing end users from creating accounts via the registration link. Second, the login and registration FreeMarker templates are updated. The login template now shows the registration link only if `registrationAllowed` is true. The registration template includes a debug block for form fields, explicitly defines required fields, and renders additional fields not explicitly required.

- In the Keycloak realm configuration, self-registration is disabled by setting the `registrationAllowed` flag to false, preventing end users from creating accounts via the registration link.

- The login and registration FreeMarker templates have been updated. The login template conditionally displays the registration link only when the realm's `registrationAllowed` flag is true. The registration template includes:

  - A debug block to display available form fields, hidden by default with CSS `display: none;`.
  
  - Explicitly defined required fields: `username`, `email`, `first name`, `last name`, `password`, and `password confirmation`.
  
  - Additional fields from the form data are rendered only if they are not among the explicitly defined required fields.

These changes enhance control over user self-registration and improve the registration form's structure and debugging capabilities.
