This update introduces no user-facing changes and does not impact the frontend. Therefore, there are no screenshots or videos to display.

This update introduces two key changes for improved code readability and data security:

- In `src/backend/api.py`, the `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` setting has been reformatted for consistency with other multiline assignments, without altering its functionality.

- The template retrieval logic in `src/backend/routes/ui_templates.py` now filters by the user's organization ID, ensuring users access only their organization's templates, enhancing data integrity and security.

Additionally, minor import reordering in `src/backend/routes/ui_assets_proxy.py` improves code organization.
