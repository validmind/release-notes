# PR Summary

This PR introduces two primary changes:

1. In the backend API configuration (src/backend/api.py), the assignment of the SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW setting has been reformatted to improve code readability. Although the functionality remains the same, the code style is now consistent with other multiline assignments.

2. The main functional enhancement is in the template retrieval logic (src/backend/routes/ui_templates.py). Previously, the code queried for a template solely based on a unique identifier. With the changes, the query now also filters based on the current user's organization (using g.current_user_org.id), ensuring that users can only access templates that belong to their own organization. This adjustment enhances both data integrity and security.

Minor import reordering and cleanup in src/backend/routes/ui_assets_proxy.py have also been performed which improves the overall code organization and clarity.
