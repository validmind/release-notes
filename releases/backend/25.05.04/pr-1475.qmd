This update does not introduce any user-facing changes and does not affect the frontend. There are no screenshots or videos to display.

This update introduces two key changes:

- The `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` setting in `src/backend/api.py` has been reformatted for better readability. The functionality remains the same, but the code style now matches other multiline assignments.

- The template retrieval logic in `src/backend/routes/ui_templates.py` has been improved. Templates are now queried by both a unique identifier and the user's organization (`g.current_user_org.id`), ensuring users access only their organization's templates, enhancing data integrity and security.

Additionally, minor import reordering and cleanup in `src/backend/routes/ui_assets_proxy.py` have been performed for improved code organization and clarity.
