This update does not introduce any user-facing changes. There are no modifications to existing behavior, and no visual elements have been altered, so screenshots or videos are not applicable.

This update introduces two key changes for improved code readability and data security. 

- The `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` setting in `src/backend/api.py` has been reformatted for better readability, aligning with other multiline assignments without altering functionality.

- The template retrieval logic in `src/backend/routes/ui_templates.py` now filters by the user's organization, enhancing data integrity and security by ensuring users access only their organization's templates.

Additionally, minor import reordering and cleanup in `src/backend/routes/ui_assets_proxy.py` enhance code organization.
