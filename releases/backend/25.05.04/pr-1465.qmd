A critical vulnerability has been fixed to enhance data security. Previously, users could be added to the owners list and access personally identifiable information (PII) without verifying their organization membership. This update ensures that users can only access data from their own organization and group, thereby protecting sensitive information.

This update enhances user membership and ownership handling in the application:

- The unused `flask_migrate` import has been removed from the backend API module, simplifying project dependencies.

- The `RolePermission` import in the authentication module has been repositioned for clearer dependency management.

- A new `is_member` method in the `Group` class checks if a user is already a member, centralizing membership checks.

- The UI inventory models route now verifies user existence and group membership before adding them as an owner or developer, ensuring robust ownership assignments.
