A critical vulnerability has been fixed to prevent unauthorized users from being added to the owners list and accessing personally identifiable information (PII) without verifying their organizational membership. This update safeguards PII and ensures users can only access data within their own organization and group.

This update enhances user membership and ownership handling in the application with several improvements:

- Removed the unused `flask_migrate` import from the backend API module, streamlining project dependencies.

- Repositioned the `RolePermission` import in the authentication module for clearer dependency management.

- Added a new `is_member` method to the `Group` class, which checks if a user is already a group member, centralizing membership logic.

- Improved the UI inventory models route by ensuring users exist and are group members before assigning them as owners or developers, preventing unauthorized assignments.
