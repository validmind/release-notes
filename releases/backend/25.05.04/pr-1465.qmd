# PR Summary
This PR introduces several functional improvements to enhance the handling of user membership and ownership in the application:

1. In the backend API module, the unused import of flask_migrate has been removed, cleaning up the dependencies of the project.

2. In the authentication module, the RolePermission import has been repositioned. While its functional impact is minimal, this change contributes to clearer dependency management.

3. A new method, is_member, has been added to the Group class. This method iterates over group members to check whether a given user is already a member. This helper function centralizes group membership checks and clarifies the intent of the membership logic.

4. In the UI inventory models route, the logic for adding an owner to the inventory model has been enhanced. The route now checks if the user exists and is a member of the group before adding them as an owner or developer. This prevents non-existent or unauthorized users from being mistakenly added, ensuring more robust handling of ownership assignments.
