This PR updates the startup command for the API service in the Docker entrypoint script. The previous command used the Python module flag `-m` with a file path, which might not have worked as expected. The updated command removes the `-m` flag and directly executes the script file using `ddtrace-run`. This change ensures the API service starts correctly, utilizing `ddtrace` for instrumentation as intended.
