# PR Summary

This PR modifies the startup command for the API service in the Docker entrypoint script. Previously, the command used the Python module flag (-m) with a file path which might not have behaved as expected. The updated command removes the -m flag and directly executes the script file using ddtrace-run. This change ensures the API service is started correctly, leveraging ddtrace for instrumentation as intended.
