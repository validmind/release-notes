This update does not introduce new functionality or change existing behavior, so there are no user-facing changes to report. No visual elements like screenshots or videos are needed, as the update does not impact the user interface or experience.

This update simplifies the API service startup process by removing the `debugpy` integration from the `docker-entrypoint.sh` file. Previously, the container started the API service with `debugpy` enabled, listening on `0.0.0.0:5678`. Now, the service starts directly using `ddtrace-run`, eliminating the need for `debugpy`. This change is aimed at streamlining production deployments where remote debugging is unnecessary.
