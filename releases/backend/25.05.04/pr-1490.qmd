# PR Summary

This PR removes the debugpy integration from the API service startup command in the docker-entrypoint.sh file. Previously, the container launched the API service with debugpy enabled (listening on 0.0.0.0:5678). With this change, the command now directly starts the API service using ddtrace-run without invoking debugpy. This adjustment simplifies the startup process for production deployments where remote debugging is not required or desired.
