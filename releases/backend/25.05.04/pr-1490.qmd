title: "Remove `debugpy` from API service startup

This update removes the `debugpy` integration from the API service startup command in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` file. Previously, the container launched the API service with `debugpy` enabled, listening on `0.0.0.0:5678`. Now, the command directly starts the API service using `ddtrace-run` without invoking `debugpy`. This change simplifies the startup process for production deployments where remote debugging is not needed. This update enhances user experience by improving performance and streamlining processes. Users will benefit from these optimizations (#1490)"
