title: "Remove `debugpy` from API service startup

This update eliminates the `debugpy` integration from the API service startup command in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` file. Previously, the container started the API service with `debugpy` enabled, listening on `0.0.0.0:5678`. Now, the command directly starts the API service using `ddtrace-run` without `debugpy`. This change simplifies the startup process for production deployments where remote debugging is unnecessary (#1490)"
