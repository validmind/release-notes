This pull request adds a new configuration block to the GitHub Actions workflow for the Python application. The concurrency settings ensure that only the most recent workflow run remains active by grouping runs by workflow and branch reference. This change cancels any in-progress runs when a new run is triggered, saving CI resources and reducing potential conflicts from concurrent executions.
