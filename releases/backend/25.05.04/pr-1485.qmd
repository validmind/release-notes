This update enhances existing functionality. No screenshots or videos are included.

This update simplifies the authentication process by eliminating the fallback logic for token extraction from cookies. The functions `get_token_auth_cookie` and `get_token_auth_header_or_cookie` have been removed. Authentication now exclusively uses the token provided in the header via `get_token_auth_header`.

Additionally, changes have been made to the UI assets proxy endpoint. The `requires_auth` decorator and organization access check logic have been removed. The endpoint now directly retrieves a pre-signed URL from object storage, bypassing previous authorization checks for asset access.
