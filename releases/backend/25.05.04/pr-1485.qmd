# PR Summary

This PR streamlines the authentication process by removing the fallback logic that previously allowed token extraction from cookies. The functions get_token_auth_cookie and get_token_auth_header_or_cookie have been removed, and authentication now strictly relies on the token provided in the header using get_token_auth_header. 

Additionally, in the UI assets proxy endpoint, the requires_auth decorator has been removed and the organization access check logic has been stripped out. The assets endpoint now directly retrieves a pre-signed URL from the object storage without validating the organization of the user. This simplification could impact previously enforced authorization checks for asset access.
