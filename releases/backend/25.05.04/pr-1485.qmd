This update enhances user experience by addressing previous inefficiencies to improve performance and usability. There are no breaking changes in this update. No screenshots or videos are included.

This update simplifies the authentication process by eliminating the fallback logic that extracted tokens from cookies. The functions `get_token_auth_cookie` and `get_token_auth_header_or_cookie` have been removed. Authentication now strictly uses the token provided in the header via `get_token_auth_header`.

In the UI assets proxy endpoint, the `requires_auth` decorator and organization access check logic have been removed. The endpoint now directly retrieves a pre-signed URL from object storage without validating the user's organization, potentially affecting previous authorization checks for asset access.
