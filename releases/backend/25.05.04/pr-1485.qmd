This update does not introduce any user-facing changes. There are no screenshots or videos provided for this update.

This update simplifies the authentication process by removing the fallback logic for token extraction from cookies. The functions `get_token_auth_cookie` and `get_token_auth_header_or_cookie` have been eliminated. Authentication now exclusively uses the token provided in the header via `get_token_auth_header`.

In the UI assets proxy endpoint, the `requires_auth` decorator and organization access checks have been removed. The endpoint now directly retrieves a pre-signed URL from object storage without validating the user's organization, potentially impacting previous authorization checks for asset access.
