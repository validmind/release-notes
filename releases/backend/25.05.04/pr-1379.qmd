This update refreshes the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to align with newer releases of the Go toolchain and several indirect dependencies. The toolchain is upgraded from `go1.23.1` to `go1.24.1`, and versions for modules such as `golang.org/x/crypto`, `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/sys`, and `golang.org/x/text` are also updated. These changes ensure the project benefits from the latest features, improvements, and compatibility enhancements in the Go ecosystem without altering any functional business logic.
