This update enhances security by ensuring UI workflow states endpoints access only organization-specific data. Workflows are now retrieved through `g.current_user_org.workflows`, limiting access to the current user's organization. This change applies to GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints, reducing data leakage risks. Additionally, `ResourceNotFoundError` exceptions are explicitly rethrown for precise error signaling, while other exceptions result in an `InternalServerError`. These improvements ensure secure data access and clearer error handling.
