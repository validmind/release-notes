This update enhances security by ensuring that UI workflow states endpoints access data specific to the user's organization. Instead of querying the global workflow model, endpoints now use `g.current_user_org.workflows`, applicable to GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations. This change minimizes data leakage risks between organizations. Additionally, `ResourceNotFoundError` exceptions are now explicitly rethrown for precise error signaling, while other exceptions are returned as `InternalServerError`. These improvements ensure secure data access and clearer error handling.
