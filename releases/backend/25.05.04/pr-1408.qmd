This update improves the backend template serialization process by adding a `global_id` key to the payload generated by the `serialize_template` function. The `global_id` is derived from the `base_template` property and is included with other metadata like `template_cuid`, `template`, and `created_at`. This change enhances traceability and consistency by ensuring each serialized output includes a unique global identifier.
