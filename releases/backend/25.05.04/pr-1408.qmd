This update improves template serialization in the backend by adding a `global_id` key to the payload generated by the `serialize_template` function. The `global_id`, derived from the `base_template` property, is included alongside metadata like `template_cuid`, `template`, and `created_at`. This addition enhances traceability and consistency across the system by providing a unique global identifier for each template.
