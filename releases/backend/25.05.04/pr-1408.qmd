# PR Summary

This PR introduces a functional enhancement to the template serialization process in the backend. The change involves adding a new key, `global_id`, to the payload generated by the `serialize_template` function. The `global_id` is sourced from the `base_template` property of the template object and is included alongside other metadata such as `template_cuid`, `template`, and `created_at`.

The update ensures that the serialized output now carries a unique global identifier, which can help improve traceability and consistency across different parts of the system that utilize these template definitions.
