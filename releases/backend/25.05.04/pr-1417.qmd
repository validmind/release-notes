This pull request updates deployment workflow configurations in three YAML files: `deploy_aws_secondary.yaml`, `deploy_prod.yaml`, and `deploy_staging.yaml`. The primary change is the switch to using the new template file `values-new.yaml` from the `templates/validmind` directory, replacing the old `values.yaml`. This update ensures deployments use the latest configuration settings. The `sed` commands still replace placeholder strings with environment-specific values like site, environment, vault ID, repository, and API SHA, maintaining consistency across deployments.
