# PR Summary

This pull request modifies the deployment workflow configurations in three YAML files (deploy_aws_secondary.yaml, deploy_prod.yaml, and deploy_staging.yaml). The primary change is to update the copy operation so that the workflows now use the new template file (values-new.yaml) located in the templates/validmind directory instead of the old values.yaml. This change ensures that deployments will use the updated configuration settings. The sed commands remain responsible for replacing templated placeholder strings with environment-specific values (such as site, environment, vault id, repository, and API SHA), ensuring consistency across deployments.
