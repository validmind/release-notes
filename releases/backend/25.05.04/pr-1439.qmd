This update introduces two key changes: 

- You can now export comments in both documentation and monitoring reports.
- A database query issue related to exporting comments has been fixed.

These enhancements respond to customer requests for improved comment visibility.

This update improves the management and display of user comments linked to inventory models in reports. Key enhancements include:

- The `get_user_comments_by_model_id` method now accepts a `content_type` parameter for filtering and joining with the Metadata table, ensuring comments are fetched according to the report type.

- A new function, `render_comment_fragments`, centralizes the logic for rendering comment fragments, formatting text, and handling nullable fields like `context` and `created_at`.

- Report serialization functions now support an `include_comments` option, adding a 'Comments' section to reports when enabled.

- Unit tests have been updated to validate scenarios such as comment rendering with and without the `include_comments` flag, filtering out irrelevant comments, and supporting enhanced annotation creation.

These changes enhance the robustness and flexibility of comment handling, enabling better report customization and filtering.
