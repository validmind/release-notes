This update enhances security for the UI assets proxy endpoint by implementing authentication and organization-level access control. Key changes include:

- Requiring authentication for the previously unprotected endpoint.
- Enforcing organization-level access control to ensure users access only their organization's assets.
- Supporting authentication token retrieval from cookies if the `Authorization` header is absent.
- Validating that requested assets belong to the user's organization.

These changes address a security vulnerability, preventing unauthorized access to private assets.

This update enhances the backend's authentication and authorization processes by introducing new methods for token retrieval and enforcing stricter access controls. 

- The `get_token_auth_cookie` function retrieves an access token from an authorization cookie if it's not in the headers.

- The `get_token_auth_header_or_cookie` function combines header and cookie methods for token extraction, replacing the previous `get_token_auth_header` method in authentication decorators.

- An authentication decorator (`@requires_auth()`) is added to the asset serving endpoint in the UI Assets Proxy, ensuring API access is restricted to authenticated users.

- The endpoint now checks authorization by matching the asset key's organization identifier with the current user's organization, raising an unauthorized error if they do not match.

These changes improve the authentication mechanism by supporting multiple token sources and ensuring assets are accessed only within the correct organizational context.
