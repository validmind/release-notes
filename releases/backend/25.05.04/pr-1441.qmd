This update introduces logging functionality and increases the maximum number of worker threads.

This pull request introduces two key changes:

- The Celery configuration now has an increased worker concurrency from 4 to 6, as updated in the `celery_config.py` file. This enhancement allows more tasks to be processed simultaneously, improving performance during high workloads.

- A new logging statement has been added to the `workflows.py` module. It logs the process of finding available workflows based on a field change, including the field key and associated organization. This aids in debugging and tracking execution flow when querying workflows.
