This update introduces logging capabilities and increases the maximum number of worker threads.

This update includes two key changes:

- The worker concurrency in the Celery configuration has been increased from 4 to 6. This change, located in the `celery_config.py` file, is intended to improve performance by enabling more tasks to be processed simultaneously, especially during high workloads.

- A new logging statement has been added to the workflow tasks module (`workflows.py`). This log captures the process of identifying available workflows when a field changes, detailing the field key and the associated organization. This addition is meant to aid in debugging and tracking the execution flow during workflow queries.
