#### What
Adding logging and increasing max number of worker threads

# PR Summary

This pull request introduces two functional changes:

1. In the Celery configuration, the worker concurrency has been increased from 4 to 6. This is intended to allow more tasks to be processed in parallel, addressing performance bottlenecks when the application workload increases. The change is located in the 'celery_config.py' file.

2. A new logging statement has been added in the workflow tasks module ('workflows.py') to log the process of finding available workflows based on a field change. This log entry includes the field key and the organization associated with the model. This should help in debugging and tracking the execution flow when workflows are queried.
