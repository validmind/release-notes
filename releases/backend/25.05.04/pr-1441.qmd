This update introduces logging functionality and increases the maximum number of worker threads.

This update includes two key changes to improve performance and debugging:

- The Celery worker concurrency has been increased from 4 to 6 in the `celery_config.py` file. This adjustment allows more tasks to be processed simultaneously, helping to alleviate performance bottlenecks during high workloads.

- A new logging statement has been added to `workflows.py`. It logs the process of finding available workflows based on field changes, including the field key and associated organization. This aids in debugging and tracking execution flow when querying workflows.
