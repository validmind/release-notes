Admins can no longer modify staff roles using the `PATCH /api/v1/roles/<protected_role_id>/permissions` endpoint. This change addresses a potential security vulnerability.

This update refactors the role management endpoints in the backend for improved consistency and security. Key changes include renaming the variable `orgRole` to `org_role` in the GET and PATCH endpoints for better readability. Additionally, the PATCH endpoint now includes a check to prevent modifications to roles marked as `staff`, aligning with existing restrictions on `admin` roles. These adjustments enhance code maintainability and enforce stricter role-based access controls.

- Consistent Naming: The variable `orgRole` is now `org_role` to follow snake_case conventions.

- Enhanced Role Protection: The PATCH endpoint now prevents changes to `staff` roles, similar to `admin` roles.

- Minor Refactoring: Includes systematic renaming and logic adjustments for consistency and better permission handling.
