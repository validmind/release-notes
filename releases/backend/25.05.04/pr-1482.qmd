Admins can no longer modify staff roles using the `PATCH /api/v1/roles/<protected_role_id>/permissions` endpoint. This change addresses a potential security vulnerability.

This update refactors role management endpoints in the backend, focusing on consistent naming and enhanced role protection. The variable `orgRole` is now `org_role` in the GET and PATCH endpoints for better readability. A new check in the PATCH endpoint prevents changes to roles marked as `staff`, ensuring both `admin` and `staff` roles remain immutable. Minor refactoring includes systematic renaming and logic adjustments to maintain consistency and enforce role-based restrictions.

- Consistent Naming: The variable `orgRole` is now `org_role` in the GET and PATCH endpoints, following snake_case conventions for improved readability.

- Enhanced Role Protection: The PATCH endpoint now includes a check to prevent modifications to `staff` roles, similar to the existing protection for `admin` roles, ensuring immutability.

- Minor Refactoring: Systematic renaming and logic adjustments enhance consistency and enforce role-based restrictions.
