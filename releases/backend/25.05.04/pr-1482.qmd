Admins can no longer modify staff roles using the `PATCH /api/v1/roles/<protected_role_id>/permissions` endpoint. This change addresses a potential security vulnerability.

This update refactors role management endpoints in the backend for improved consistency and protection. Key changes include renaming the `orgRole` variable to `org_role` for better readability and introducing a check in the PATCH endpoint to prevent modifications to `staff` roles, similar to the existing protection for `admin` roles. These adjustments enhance code maintainability and enforce role-based restrictions.

The primary changes include:

- Consistent Naming: The variable previously named `orgRole` has been renamed to `org_role` throughout the GET and PATCH endpoints to follow snake_case conventions and improve code readability.

- Enhanced Role Protection: In the PATCH endpoint, an additional check has been introduced to prevent modifications to roles marked as `staff`, similar to the existing constraint for `admin` roles. This ensures that both admin and staff roles remain immutable via this endpoint.

- Minor Refactoring: The changes include systematic renaming and minor logic adjustments to maintain consistency across related queries and handling of permissions. Overall, these changes should improve maintainability and enforce proper role-based restrictions within the application.
