This update resolves an issue where a `PUT` request for a workflow would return an error due to a validation problem with the trigger type. The error was caused by the workflow returning itself, leading to a conflict with an existing workflow that shared the same trigger type.

This update enhances workflow validation by introducing an `update_cuid` parameter to the `validate_trigger_type` method, ensuring the current workflow is excluded from duplicate checks during updates. In the UI workflows route, a `BadRequestError` is re-raised for clearer error propagation, while other exceptions are wrapped in `InternalServerError`. These improvements ensure accurate duplication checks and better error handling.

The `validate_trigger_type` method now includes an `update_cuid` parameter, preventing false positives by excluding the current workflow from duplicate checks based on `cuid` during updates.

Query filtering for existing workflows has been adjusted to exclude the workflow with the `cuid` provided via `update_cuid`, ensuring accurate validation.

In `src/backend/routes/ui_workflows.py`, exception handling is refined. A `BadRequestError` is re-raised for clarity, while other exceptions are wrapped in `InternalServerError`, improving error handling during updates.
