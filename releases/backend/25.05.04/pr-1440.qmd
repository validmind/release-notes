This update resolves an issue where a `PUT` request for a workflow resulted in an error due to a validation conflict with the trigger type. The error was caused by the workflow returning itself, which conflicted with an existing workflow sharing the same trigger type.

This update improves workflow validation by adding the `update_cuid` parameter to the `validate_trigger_type` method. This ensures that the current workflow record is excluded from duplicate checks when updating. The query now filters out the workflow with the `cuid` specified by `update_cuid`, preventing false positives. In `src/backend/routes/ui_workflows.py`, exception handling is refined to re-raise `BadRequestError` for clearer error propagation, distinguishing it from general exceptions. These changes enhance duplication checks and error handling during updates.
