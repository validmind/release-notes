This update resolves an issue where a `PUT` request for a workflow would fail due to a validation error with the trigger type. The problem arose when the workflow returned itself, leading to a conflict with an existing workflow that shared the same trigger type.

This update improves workflow validation in the backend by adding the `update_cuid` parameter to the `validate_trigger_type` method. This ensures that the current workflow record is excluded from duplicate checks when updating an existing workflow. The query filtering now excludes workflows identified by `cuid` via `update_cuid`, preventing false positives. Additionally, in the UI workflows route (`src/backend/routes/ui_workflows.py`), exception handling is refined by explicitly re-raising `BadRequestError` for clearer error propagation. These changes enhance workflow update accuracy and error handling.
