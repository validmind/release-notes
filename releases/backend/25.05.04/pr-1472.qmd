Kubernetes pod specifications require environment variables to be enclosed in quotes, which causes Python to interpret them as strings. This can lead to issues with SQLAlchemy, which expects integer values. This update ensures that when these environment variables are set by the Kubernetes pod specification, they are correctly cast to integers.

This pull request improves the Flask application's configuration by ensuring that the SQLAlchemy environment variables `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE` and `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` are explicitly converted to integers. Previously, these values were used directly from environment variables as strings, which could lead to type mismatches. This update enforces the correct data type, reducing potential runtime errors related to database connection pooling configurations.
