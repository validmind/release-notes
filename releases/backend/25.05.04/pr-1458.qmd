We have fixed a vulnerability that allowed normal users to escalate their permissions to admin level. This change eliminates the privilege escalation issue.

This update improves user role management by refining the authorization mechanism and enhancing variable naming for clarity.

In the POST endpoint, authorization now specifies `resource="Role"` and `action="create"` for precise control, replacing the generic `refresh="api-async"` parameter. Similarly, the DELETE endpoint uses `resource="Role"` with `action="delete"` to better align with permission requirements.

The variable `user` has been renamed to `to_update_user` to accurately represent the user being updated. This change ensures consistency in checking organization membership and creating role assignments. Additionally, the event publishing call now correctly references the updated user variable, ensuring events are generated with the correct user information.
