We have fixed a vulnerability that allowed normal users to escalate their permissions and become admins. This change eliminates the privilege escalation issue.

This update enhances user role management endpoints by refining the authorization mechanism and improving variable naming for clarity.

The POST endpoint's authorization now specifies `resource="Role"` and `action="create"`, replacing the generic `refresh="api-async"` parameter for more precise control. Similarly, the DELETE endpoint uses `resource="Role"` and `action="delete"` to better reflect permission requirements.

The variable `user` has been renamed to `to_update_user` for clarity, ensuring consistency in organization membership checks and role assignments. The event publishing call now correctly references this updated variable, ensuring accurate event generation.
