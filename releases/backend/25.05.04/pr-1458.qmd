This update resolves a security issue where regular users could improperly escalate their permissions to become admins. The privilege escalation vulnerability has been removed.

This update improves user role management by refining the authorization process and enhancing variable naming for clarity. The POST endpoint now uses `resource="Role"` and `action="create"` for precise control, replacing the generic `refresh="api-async"` parameter. Similarly, the DELETE endpoint specifies `resource="Role"` with `action="delete"` to align with permission requirements. The variable `user` is renamed to `to_update_user` for clarity, ensuring consistency in organization membership checks and role assignments. Event publishing now correctly references the updated user variable.
