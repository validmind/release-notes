This update enhances Docker configuration and startup logic to improve service orchestration and dependency management. Key changes include:

- Updated `Dockerfile` to install utilities like `jq`, `postgresql-client-15`, and `redis-tools` for better operations and debugging.
  
- Modified `docker-compose.yaml` to add port mapping (9000) for Keycloak and set `KC_HEALTH_ENABLED` for health checks.
  
- Improved `docker-entrypoint.sh` with readiness checks for Postgres, Redis, and Keycloak, ensuring services are available before starting the application.
  
- Updated Keycloak `Dockerfile` to expose port 9000.

These enhancements ensure critical services are healthy before application processes begin, improving deployment resilience.
