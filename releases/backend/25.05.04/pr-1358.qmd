This update enhances Docker configuration and startup logic to improve service orchestration and dependency management. The `Dockerfile` now installs utilities like `jq`, `postgresql-client-15`, and `redis-tools` for better operations and debugging. The `docker-compose.yaml` file includes a new port mapping (9000) for Keycloak and sets the `KC_HEALTH_ENABLED` environment variable for health checks. The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script now performs readiness checks for Postgres, Redis, and Keycloak, ensuring services are available before starting the application. The Keycloak `Dockerfile` has been updated to expose the new port (9000). These changes enhance the resilience of container-based deployments by ensuring critical services are healthy before application processes begin.
