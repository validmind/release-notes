This update enhances the workflow trigger mechanism and inventory model field update handling. Key improvements include increased Celery worker concurrency, a new `trigger_field_key` in workflows for specific field change triggers, and updates to the `InventoryModel` update method to return both updated and old values. The Workflow model now supports additional trigger types, and validation methods have been improved. API endpoints have been updated to handle `trigger_field_key`, and the `WorkflowManager` now includes type hints and better documentation.

- Increased Celery worker concurrency from 5 to 6 in the `Makefile`, potentially improving parallel task processing.

- Added a new migration to introduce the optional column `trigger_field_key` in the workflows table. This field supports triggering workflows based on specific field changes in inventory models.

- Updated the `InventoryModel` update method to return both the updated field information and the old value, allowing further processing by triggering background tasks.

- Expanded the Workflow model:
  - Now supports an additional trigger type and extended its allowed entities and events with a new `InventoryModel.field` type and an `updated` event type.
  - New helper properties (`is_deleted` and `is_enabled`) were added for easier status checking.
  - The workflow serialization method now includes the new `trigger_field_key`.

- Enhanced the workflow validation methods to validate the `trigger_field_key` along with type, entity name, and event type. Validation errors now use a custom `BadRequestError` with more descriptive error messages.

- Updated the API endpoints in the UI routes for workflows and inventory models to pass and process the `trigger_field_key`. When a model field changes, a new Celery task (`on_model_field_change`) is triggered to process workflow executions.

- The `WorkflowManager`'s `start_execution` method now includes type hints and improved documentation. Minor adjustments in test files ensure that date comparisons use timezone-aware datetime objects.

These changes improve the robustness and clarity of the workflow triggering mechanism with extended support for specific field updates in inventory models and refined error handling.
