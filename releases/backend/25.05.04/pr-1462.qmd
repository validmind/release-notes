This update improves the validation process for the `PUT /api/v1/statuses-workflows/{id}/status` endpoint. It ensures that users cannot change the workflow status of organizations they do not belong to, thereby addressing a potential security concern.

This update introduces the `get_status_for_org` static method, which simplifies status retrieval by joining `StatusesWorkflowStatus` and `StatusesWorkflow` tables using organization and workflow identifiers. This method replaces redundant queries in the edit endpoint, enhancing efficiency and clarity. Minor refactoring improves code formatting and readability. Unit tests ensure the method correctly handles matching, non-matching, and invalid status identifiers.

The new `get_status_for_org` method streamlines status retrieval by joining relevant tables based on organization and workflow identifiers. It replaces redundant queries in the edit endpoint, offering a more efficient data access pattern.

Minor refactoring has improved block documentation and validation report functions for better code readability. Unit tests verify the method's performance in both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring it handles mismatched or invalid identifiers appropriately.
