This update improves the validation process for the `PUT /api/v1/statuses-workflows/{id}/status` endpoint, ensuring users cannot change the workflow status of organizations they do not belong to. This enhancement addresses a security issue by preventing unauthorized users from modifying the workflow status of organizations they are not members of.

This update introduces the `get_status_for_org` static method, streamlining the retrieval of statuses by joining the `StatusesWorkflowStatus` and `StatusesWorkflow` tables using organization and workflow identifiers. This method replaces redundant queries in the edit endpoint, improving data access efficiency. Minor refactoring has enhanced code formatting and readability in block documentation and validation report functions. Unit tests verify the method's accuracy in handling both matching and non-matching identifiers.
