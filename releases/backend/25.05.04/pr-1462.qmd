This update improves the validation for the `PUT /api/v1/statuses-workflows/{id}/status` endpoint. It now prevents users from altering the workflow status of organizations they are not part of, thereby addressing a potential security issue.

This update introduces the `get_status_for_org` static method, streamlining the retrieval of status by joining the `StatusesWorkflowStatus` and `StatusesWorkflow` tables using organization and workflow identifiers. This method replaces redundant queries in the edit endpoint, improving data access efficiency. Minor refactoring has enhanced code formatting and readability. Unit tests verify the method's accuracy in handling both valid and invalid organization, workflow, and status identifiers.
