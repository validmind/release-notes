Updates to Casbin:

- User policies now use group-based (`g`) policies instead of `p` type.
- Permission verification in `auth.py` retrieves the organization from the specified resource rather than the connected user.

This update improves RBAC policy generation and permission verification.

The SQL query for user role policies now separates policies for user update roles and group assignments, introducing `UserUpdateRole` for consistent policy capture.

In the backend, the authentication module's permission verification logic has been refactored:

- `get_base_resource_type` determines a resource's base type, simplifying sub-resource handling.
- `get_resource_id` derives the resource ID from request arguments and uses the new base resource check for Organization resources.
- `get_resource_organization` retrieves the organization associated with a resource using model-specific class methods.

Model classes (`Group`, `InventoryModel`, `StatusesWorkflow`, and `Template`) now include a class method, `get_organization`, to standardize organization lookup logic.

The test case for Casbin policies has been updated to verify that only the intended policy rule (`UserUpdateRole`) is returned with the correct user identifier.
