Input validation for custom fields is improved by removing potentially harmful tags like `javascript`, preventing browsers from executing these inputs. This change enforces limitations on entries in custom inventory fields to enhance security.

This update enhances the backend with a new input sanitation utility.

- **Dependency Updates**:
  - Updated Poetry to version 2.1.2.
  - Added `bleach`, `tinycss2`, and `webencodings` for HTML sanitization and CSS parsing.
  - Adjusted package compatibility markers.

- **Input Sanitization Implementation**:
  - Introduced the `InputSanitation` class in `src/backend/utils/input_sanitation.py` to sanitize HTML by removing disallowed script tags, stripping malicious URL protocols, and cleaning harmful attributes using `bleach`.
  - Integrated the sanitizer into `src/backend/routes/ui_inventory_models.py` to sanitize content before updating inventory models.

- **Testing Enhancements**:
  - Added unit tests in `tests/unit/test_input_sanitation.py` for input sanitation, covering allowed tags, attribute handling, script tag removal, URL protocol sanitization, nested protocols, and real-world HTML examples, including CKEditor-specific markup.

These changes improve application security by preventing unsafe HTML content and potential XSS vectors while ensuring data consistency through rigorous sanitization and robust unit testing.
