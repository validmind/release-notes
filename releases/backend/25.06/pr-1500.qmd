A template for model source code documentation has been added. It supports version v0 of the code explainer LLM feature and can demonstrate this feature to customers.

This update includes two main changes:

- In the `tracking.py` module, the request parameter `additional_instructions` has been renamed to `user_instructions`. This change affects JSON payload validation in the `generate_code_explainer` endpoint, aligning the field name with the expected convention.

- A new YAML template, `model_source_code.yaml`, has been introduced to standardize AI/ML model documentation. It includes sections for code overview, environment setup, data handling, model implementation, training and evaluation, inference, configuration management, testing, logging, version control, security, execution examples, and known issues.
