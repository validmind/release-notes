A vulnerability in the `POST /users` endpoint of the inventory model allowed unauthorized access.

This update improves owner handling in the Findings API, affecting migration scripts, model methods, and UI route handlers.

Key changes include:

- The `Finding` model's methods, `create_from_json` and `update_from_json`, now accept an optional `owner` parameter. If not provided, the system defaults to the current user, centralizing owner assignment logic.

- UI routes in the `post_finding` and `update_finding` endpoints now require an `owner_cuid` in the validation rules. These endpoints query the user based on `owner_cuid` and the current organization, raising an error if no matching user is found.

- Minor formatting and code adjustments, such as adding trailing commas in filter clauses, improve code clarity and consistency.
