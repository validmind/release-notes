This update improves user experience and ensures technical accuracy.

Modifications to `API` endpoints may affect existing integrations. Users should review the updated documentation for compatibility.

Frontend interface improvements offer a more intuitive and streamlined experience, enhancing usability and accessibility. Users are encouraged to review the provided screenshots and videos to understand the impact and adjust workflows accordingly.

The update improves the authentication module by enhancing resource handling and logging.

In the `get_base_resource_type` function, a new check logs a warning and returns the given `resource_type` if the resource lookup is `None`, clarifying missing resources.

The `get_resource_id` function now supports custom dynamic resources. For the `resource_type` "CustomField," it prefixes the resource type with "cf_" based on the "key" from the view arguments, ensuring correct identification and processing of custom fields.

A new local variable, `local_resource_id`, improves readability by separating the logic for retrieving resource identifiers. Organization-related logic assigns the organization identifier (or a placeholder "*") to this variable if needed.
