The `vm.experimental.agents.run_task` interface in the ValidMind library now supports a new task type: `qualitative_text_generation`. This update introduces an API endpoint for generating qualitative text, enabling users to create qualitative sections for specific document parts using the LLM. The generated content appears in the `model_overview` text block section.

The new API endpoint `/ai/generate/qualitative_text_generation` is available for qualitative text generation. The `generate_qualitative_text` function:

- Validates the JSON request body, ensuring the `content_id` field is present.
- Uses global context (`g`) information such as `model_cuid` and `document_type`, and maps optional `user_instructions` to a `content` field.
- Processes the request with `qualitative_text_generation.invoke` and returns the result in a JSON response.
