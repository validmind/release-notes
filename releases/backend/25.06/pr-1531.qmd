New routes have been added to access permissions for custom fields.

This update includes several enhancements and bug fixes:

- The CASBIN database URI in GitHub Actions now uses the service alias `db`.

- The admin user management script now uses the Flask app context for resource access, with refactored user upsertion logic based on authentication configuration.

- RBAC utilities now use context managers for file handling, improving resource safety and error handling. The initialization function verifies required SQL files, logs the process, and rolls back on errors.

- Old custom fields endpoints have been replaced with a new namespace that consolidates code testing and permissions retrieval. A new method retrieves roles (excluding admin roles) with appropriate read/write permissions for a given custom field key.

- Logging has been enhanced across modules for better troubleshooting and monitoring.

- Integration tests for text editor file uploads and custom field endpoints have been updated to ensure XSS sanitization, file size validations, and proper serialization of role data, covering unauthorized access and non-existent custom fields.
