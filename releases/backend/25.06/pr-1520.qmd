The system's behavior and frontend visuals have been updated to improve the user experience without altering existing functionalities.

The new `get_object_storage` factory method replaces direct imports of the object storage module, improving modularity and allowing flexibility for future changes in storage service implementation.

Changes include:

- In `scripts/update_data_template.py`, the `download_bytes` function uses `get_object_storage` to initialize an object storage instance based on the environment variable.

- In `src/backend/utils/report_render_helpers/__init__.py`, the `download` function uses `get_object_storage` to obtain an object storage instance.

- In `src/backend/utils/reports.py`, `get_object_storage` is used to check file existence and download template files.
