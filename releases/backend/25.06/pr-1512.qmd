The `poetry.lock` file has been updated to improve metadata and available artifacts for several packages. Key changes include:

- Adjusting Python version markers to target specific versions, such as `~= "3.12.0"` or `~= "3.11.0"`.

- Upgrading the `tornado` package to a newer version, with updated wheel files and a minimum required Python version change from 3.8 to 3.9.
