This update improves the authentication module with two key changes:

- The `get_resource_organization` function now defaults to the organization when a falsy or empty `resource_id` is provided, reducing errors and unnecessary processing.

- A new debug logging statement records details such as the organization CUID, resource type, and `resource_id`, aiding in debugging and monitoring access control decisions.
