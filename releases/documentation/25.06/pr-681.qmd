Titles in the learning paths now have consistent casing and improved clarity. Descriptions are more concise. A "Register Now" or "Coming Soon" button is added to each course based on availability. The Validator Fundamentals section is streamlined for the upcoming validation experience notebooks.

The extra "Training" drop-down in the training section has been removed to simplify navigation. There is consideration for reintroducing a sidebar or breadcrumb navigation for training pages. The `Releases` section is now an independent section in the condensed drop-down menu.

A browser compatibility message has been added to the registration pages and the "Legal Ease" section on the policy page for consistency.

This update enhances notebook execution and documentation within GitHub Actions and site content. Key changes include:

- Updated `action.yml` files for demo, production, and staging notebooks to execute multiple notebooks.
- Added a step to register the `validmind` kernel in the GitHub Actions workflow for correct notebook execution.
- Modified the execution command to target multiple notebooks, improving automated testing.

Documentation and Training Content:
- Introduced new training modules and updated existing ones for a comprehensive learning path for developers, validators, and administrators using ValidMind.
- Added detailed markdown files for each training module, outlining learning objectives, course content, and step-by-step instructions.
- Enhanced site content with new sections and updates to improve navigation and user experience.

Notebook Content and Structure:
- Reorganized the notebook directory to separate executed notebooks from tutorials for better clarity and maintainability.
- Updated notebook content to include sections on implementing custom tests and using external test providers.
- Added new images and GIFs to the documentation to visually guide users through adding content blocks and test results.
