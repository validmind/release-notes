You can now access model-validation and development notebooks directly from the library portal. Notebook numbering has been updated.

Language, links, and styling are consistent with the `API` documentation, and notebook titles are shortened.

The landing section uses a dedicated `_sidebar.yaml` for easier navigation.

The validmind.com link has been removed from the top navigation but remains in the footer.

The documentation now includes updated security sections with clearer instructions, setup guides, and examples.

You can run additional tests with broader coverage for model validation and data quality. The refactored code and reorganized test files improve readability, resolve minor execution and logging issues, and ensure that results and logs handle sensitive data more securely.
