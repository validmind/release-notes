ValidMind for model validation and development notebooks are now available in the library portal. The updated numbering structure is reflected in the side navigation and listing tiles.

The Developers > ValidMind Library portal now uses universal language and links, broadening its purpose beyond a developer portal. Consistent styling from the API documentation has been applied, resolving issues with side navigation and long notebook titles. The sidebar for this section is now in its own `_sidebar.yaml` file.

The link to validmind.com has been removed from the main top navigation, as it is already in the footer.

This update enhances the ValidMind documentation and testing framework. Documentation now includes clearer instructions, new sections, and examples for setting up and using the library for model validation and development, including custom tests and external test providers. New tests have been added, and existing ones updated to cover more scenarios in model validation and data quality. Test descriptions now detail parameters and expected outcomes. Code refactoring improves readability and maintainability, and minor bugs in test execution and logging have been fixed. Security documentation has been updated to align with best practices for handling sensitive data.
