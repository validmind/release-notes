# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content provides additional context by specifying that the validation notebooks are for "ValidMind." This clarification can be helpful for readers who may not be familiar with the term "validation notebooks" in the original content. The use of backticks around "validation" and "ValidMind" suggests that these terms might be specific to a particular software or framework, which can further aid in understanding. Overall, the edit improves the clarity and specificity of the original content.

I removed this link from the main top navigation as it doesn't need to feature so heavily when it's also in the footer, based on discussions we had during the homepage redesign.
