# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is concise and uses the imperative form, which is often preferred in technical documentation or task lists. The use of backticks around "validation" suggests that it might be a specific term or keyword, which can be helpful for clarity if it refers to a code element or specific feature. However, if "validation" is not a specific term that requires emphasis, the backticks might be unnecessary. Overall, the edit is effective for its likely context.

#### # ValidMind for model validation notebooks
These were added to the "developer" (now library) portal:

| Sidenav | Listing tiles |
|---|---|

#### # ValidMind for model development notebooks
These have the updated numbering structure:

| Sidenav | Listing tiles |
|---|---|
|<img width="361" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 2 36 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfeb49d8-62de-4e8f-91ea-604306421f74" /> | <img width="819" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 2 36 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c8f0a36-43b8-4198-89d6-4006b311be08" />|

#### # Developers > ValidMind Library
- Since this portal is much more than a developer portal, I've made the language and links surrounding the portal more universal:

| Main drop-down | Collapsed drop-down |
|---|---|
| <img width="453" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 2 35 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b9c0da-e793-40d4-9479-063d0623e16d" /> | <img width="292" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 2 34 21 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7071541-64fb-4f78-8455-fec350781843" />|

- You may notice that I also applied the styling that the API docs have to this and the notebooks/test descriptions, since it's jarring for the two sections to have different side navigations (BONUS: This also takes care of the really squished long-titles we have for notebooks!):

<img width="1706" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 2 37 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c662fb02-32e8-4d0b-b8bf-83d606671b6c" />


- I also moved the sidebar for this landing section to its own `_sidebar.yaml`:

https://github.com/validmind/documentation/blob/a89901c1e08dd3320d989474289e0cc03b652c64/site/developer/_sidebar.yaml#L3

https://github.com/validmind/documentation/blob/a89901c1e08dd3320d989474289e0cc03b652c64/site/_quarto.yml#L5

#### # validmind.com
I removed this link from the main top navigation as it doesn't need to feature so heavily when it's also in the footer, based on discussions we had during the homepage redesign. 

| Main nav | Collapsed nav |
|---|---|
