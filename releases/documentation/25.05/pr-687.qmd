Model attestation allows you and validators to certify model details at a specific time for internal governance, external compliance, status updates, and role-specific tasks. For more information, see the `Working with attestations` guide.

You can now create structured documentation for model attestations, including setup instructions, questionnaires, review workflows, an attestation guide, and a new `Attestation` glossary entry.

The Mermaid diagram theme now features updated node and edge colors, as well as rounded node corners.
