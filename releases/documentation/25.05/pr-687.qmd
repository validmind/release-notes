# CHECK: Title validation failed - The edited content is clear and concise, effectively conveying the action of updating the user guide specifically for "attestation." The use of the word "update" as a verb makes the instruction more direct and actionable. Additionally, enclosing "attestation" in backticks can imply that it is a specific term or feature, which may be helpful for clarity. Overall, the edited content is an improvement in terms of clarity and directness.

#### External Release Notes
Model attestation is now available.

Attestation allows model owners and validators to formally review and certify key details about a model at a specific point in time. This helps support internal governance and compliance with external requirements. Progress for the attestation process is tracked through clear status updates and role-specific tasks.
