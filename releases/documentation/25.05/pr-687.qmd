`Model attestation` verifies key model details at a specific time for governance and compliance. It provides clear status updates and role-specific tasks to help you track progress.

See the guide to get started.

You can now access a consolidated attestation section that includes a workflow guide (setup, questionnaires, review), a glossary entry for `Attestation`, and related guides.

The `Mermaid` diagram theme now features updated node and edge colors, along with rounded node corners.
