# PR Summary

This pull request introduces several enhancements to the documentation related to role and stakeholder type management within the platform. The key changes include:

1. **Addition of New Documentation for Model Stakeholder Types**: A new guide, `manage-model-stakeholder-types.qmd`, has been added. This document provides detailed instructions on managing model stakeholder types, including adding or editing stakeholder types, managing permissions, and applying stakeholder types to models.

2. **Enhancements to Role Management Documentation**: The `manage-roles.qmd` file has been updated to provide clearer instructions on managing roles, including adding new roles, managing role permissions, and managing users associated with roles. The documentation now includes more detailed steps and clarifications on the uniqueness of role names and stakeholder type names.

3. **Integration of Stakeholder Types in Existing Documentation**: References to model stakeholder types have been integrated into existing documentation, such as `edit-model-inventory-fields.qmd` and `manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd`. These updates ensure that stakeholder types are considered in the context of managing model inventory fields and permissions.

4. **Structural and Content Updates**: Minor structural changes, such as adjusting grid columns in `managing-users.qmd`, and content updates to improve clarity and consistency across the documentation.

These changes aim to improve the usability and clarity of the documentation related to user roles and stakeholder types, providing users with comprehensive guidance on managing access and permissions within the platform.
