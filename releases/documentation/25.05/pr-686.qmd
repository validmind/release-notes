New content has been added to the "Managing users" section, explaining how to manage model stakeholder types. This page is now included in the "Managing users" landing page tiles.

The model inventory fields documentation now includes a section on editing model stakeholders, focusing on model stakeholder types instead of outdated role permissions.

This update enhances documentation for managing roles and stakeholder types on the platform. A new guide, `manage-model-stakeholder-types.qmd`, explains how to add, edit, manage permissions, and apply stakeholder types to models. Updates to `manage-roles.qmd` clarify role management, including adding roles, managing permissions, associating users with roles, and ensuring unique names for roles and stakeholder types. Model stakeholder types are now included in `edit-model-inventory-fields.qmd` and `manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd` to ensure they are considered in managing model inventory fields and permissions. Minor structural changes, such as adjusting grid columns in `managing-users.qmd`, enhance clarity and consistency across the documentation.
