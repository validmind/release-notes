You can now manage model stakeholders more easily. A new `Model stakeholder types` page under `Managing users`, accessible from the landing page, replaces role-based references in `Model inventory fields`, allowing you to edit model stakeholders.

`manage-model-stakeholder-types.qmd`: Manage stakeholder types, assign them to models, and configure permissions.

`manage-roles.qmd`: Manage roles, set permissions, link users, and ensure unique names.

`edit-model-inventory-fields.qmd` and `manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd`: Use stakeholder types to configure inventory field permissions.

`managing-users.qmd`: Align grid columns and update wording.
