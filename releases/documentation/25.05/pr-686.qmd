You can now manage stakeholder types from the `Managing users` tile. Model inventory fields reference these stakeholder types instead of legacy role permissions. Refer to the documentation for editing instructions.

The new `manage-model-stakeholder-types.qmd` document explains how to create or edit stakeholder types, set permissions, and assign them to models. The documents `edit-model-inventory-fields.qmd` and `manage-model-inventory-fields.qmd` now reference stakeholder types.

In `manage-roles.qmd`, find instructions on creating roles, assigning permissions, linking roles to users, and following naming rules.

The `managing-users.qmd` document has minor layout adjustments for consistency.
