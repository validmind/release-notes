The Developer Fundamentals course has been updated for clarity and comprehensiveness, featuring revised login instructions, module outcomes, and summaries. Courses have been tested to ensure accurate instructions and timing. A workaround for the `Copy snippet to clipboard` slide addresses a CORS error by allowing `clipboard-read` and `clipboard-write` permissions.

Titles in the Learning Paths section have been standardized, and descriptions refined. Buttons for course registration or upcoming courses have been added. The Validator Fundamentals section has been streamlined for future updates. The extra "Training" drop-down has been removed to reduce clutter, and a `Releases` section has been added to the drop-down menu. Browser compatibility messages for registration pages and the "Legal Ease" section have been styled for clarity.

This update enhances notebook execution and documentation within GitHub Actions and site content. Key improvements include updated action names and descriptions in `action.yml` files for demo, prod, and staging notebooks, ensuring correct environments with the `validmind` kernel. Documentation now features new training modules and updated content for ValidMind users, while the notebook directory is reorganized for clarity. These changes streamline processes and offer advanced capabilities for users.

- **GitHub Actions Enhancements**: Updated `action.yml` files to reflect the execution of multiple notebooks. Registered the `validmind` kernel in the workflow to ensure the correct environment for notebook execution. Modified the execution command to target a series of notebooks, expanding automated testing.

- **Documentation and Training Content**: Introduced new training modules and updated existing ones for a comprehensive learning path for ValidMind users. Added detailed markdown files for each module, outlining objectives, content, and instructions. Enhanced site content with new sections and improved navigation.

- **Notebook Content and Structure**: Reorganized the notebook directory to separate executed notebooks from tutorials, improving clarity. Updated content to include sections on custom tests and external test providers. Added images and GIFs to guide users through adding content blocks and test results.
