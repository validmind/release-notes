The Developer Fundamentals course has been updated for clarity and comprehensiveness, featuring revised login instructions, learning outcomes, and module summaries. Courses have been tested for accuracy in instructions and time estimates. A workaround for the `Copy snippet to clipboard` slide addresses a CORS-type error, using `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"`. The layout now uses a simple two-column format.

Titles and descriptions in the Learning Paths section have been refined for consistency and readability, with buttons added for course registration or announcements. The Validator Fundamentals section has been streamlined for future updates. The extra "Training" drop-down has been removed to simplify navigation, with potential plans for sidebar or breadcrumb navigation. The `Releases` section is now a standalone item in the drop-down menu.

The browser compatibility message on registration pages is now clearer and emphasized, a format also applied to the "Legal Ease" section on the policy page.

This pull request enhances notebook execution and documentation within GitHub Actions and site content. Key updates include improved action names and descriptions in `action.yml` files, registration of the `validmind` kernel in workflows, and expanded notebook execution commands. New training modules and detailed markdown files enhance learning paths for ValidMind users. The notebook directory is reorganized for clarity, with updated content and new visuals to guide users in implementing custom tests and using external providers.

- GitHub Actions Enhancements:

  - Updated action names and descriptions in `action.yml` files for demo, prod, and staging notebooks to reflect the execution of multiple notebooks.
  
  - Added a step to register the `validmind` kernel in the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure the correct environment is used for notebook execution.
  
  - Modified the execution command to target a series of notebooks, improving the scope of automated testing.

- Documentation and Training Content:

  - Introduced new training modules and updated existing ones to provide a comprehensive learning path for developers, validators, and administrators using ValidMind.
  
  - Added detailed markdown files for each training module, outlining learning objectives, course content, and step-by-step instructions for using ValidMind.
  
  - Enhanced the site content with new sections and updates to improve navigation and user experience.

- Notebook Content and Structure:

  - Reorganized the notebook directory structure to separate executed notebooks from tutorials, improving clarity and maintainability.
  
  - Updated notebook content to include new sections on implementing custom tests and using external test providers, providing users with more advanced capabilities.
  
  - Added new images and GIFs to the documentation to visually guide users through the process of adding content blocks and test results.

These changes streamline the notebook execution process, enhance the training and documentation experience, and provide users with more robust tools for model development and validation.
