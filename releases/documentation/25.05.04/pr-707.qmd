#### # New templates section
Since templates and reusable text blocks apply to more than just model documentation (validation reports, ongoing monitoring), I moved the guides under here into a new sub-section:

#### ## Manage text block library
[**LIVE PREVIEW**](https://docs-demo.vm.validmind.ai/pr_previews/beck/sc-8990/documentation-saving-text-block-to-block/guide/templates/manage-text-block-library.html)

Net-new page for sc-8990 covering the new block library feature:

#### # Updated docs
#### Work with content blocks

[**LIVE PREVIEW**](https://docs-demo.vm.validmind.ai/pr_previews/beck/sc-8990/documentation-saving-text-block-to-block/guide/model-documentation/work-with-content-blocks.html)

- Since the insertion (and management) of blocks has changed with the block library, I updated this page to reflect the new UI:

| Updated explanation of content block types | "Add content blocks" reflects new UX | "Remove content blocks" reflects new UX |
|--|--|--|
| <img width="935" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 52 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c899d77e-a013-4016-98fb-70d103ab9cec" /> | <img width="1140" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 52 40 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ba05a9d-24b6-42e6-8a74-2c115608e813" /> | <img width="1078" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 53 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42191c9a-436e-4522-b13d-0ab616913f8e" /> |

- For sc-9386, I also updated the "Generate Text with AI" section to reflect the new chat interface:

<img width="588" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 53 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e03785d4-d4d7-44c0-91c2-16e3307495f0" />

#### ## Work with test results
[**LIVE PREVIEW**](https://docs-demo.vm.validmind.ai/pr_previews/beck/sc-8990/documentation-saving-text-block-to-block/guide/model-documentation/work-with-test-results.html)

- This page now also reflects the new test-driven block menu UX:
  ![Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 55 39 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c26e4843-5c89-4747-a1eb-d63c37ec4cc4)

- For sc-9447, I added a section on configuring the display of test results once inserted:
  <img width="1260" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 5 55 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a69b4e0-c38e-4056-b0c4-acdc2c461c46" />

#### ## Work with metrics over time
[**LIVE PREVIEW**](https://docs-demo.vm.validmind.ai/pr_previews/beck/sc-8990/documentation-saving-text-block-to-block/guide/monitoring/work-with-metrics-over-time.html)

This page now also reflects the new metric over time block menu UX:

#### External Release Notes
To support the release of our updated content block interface and the text block library, we've reorganized and expanded our documentation on templates within the ValidMind Platform. 

You can now find guides on managing templates for model documentation, validation reports, and ongoing monitoring reports under our **Guides** in the **[templates]{.smallcaps}** section, alongside a new guide on how to manage your text block library.
