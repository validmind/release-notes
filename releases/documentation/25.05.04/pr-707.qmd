The documentation has been reorganized to enhance clarity and usability. Templates and reusable text blocks, applicable to model documentation, validation reports, and ongoing monitoring, have been moved to a new sub-section. Broken links have been fixed, and aliases added to old URLs. A new page details the block library feature, and updates reflect UI changes, including the new chat interface for "Generate Text with AI." Test results and metrics over time pages now include updated UX information. The ValidMind Platform's template guides have been expanded and relocated under **Guides** in the **templates** section.

This pull request refactors the paths for documentation templates, moving them from the `model-documentation` directory to a new `templates` directory. This change impacts various files, including configuration files, guides, and release notes. Additionally, enhancements to the content block management system have been introduced. These include managing a library of reusable text blocks, configuring test result displays, and improving the user interface for adding and removing content blocks.
