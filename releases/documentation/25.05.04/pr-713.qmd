The **Validator Fundamentals** course has been enhanced for clarity and comprehensiveness, aligning it with the Developer Fundamentals course. Updates include revised login instructions, detailed module learning outcomes, module summaries, and additional slides on previously omitted topics. The course has been thoroughly tested to ensure accurate instructions and time estimates.

The revamped course consists of four modules, each with specific learning outcomes:

- **Module 1**: Using ValidMind for Model Validation
- **Module 2**: Running Data Quality Tests
- **Module 3**: Developing Challenger Models
- **Module 4**: Finalizing Validation Reports

This training series introduces the basics of using ValidMind for dataset and model validation. It covers running and logging tests with the ValidMind Library and completing your model's validation report on the ValidMind Platform. You'll learn to automate testing, populate evidence in your validation report, track finding resolution, and more. Register to take the course now!
