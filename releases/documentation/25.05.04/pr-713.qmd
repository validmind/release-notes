The **Validator Fundamentals** course has been updated for clarity and comprehensiveness, aligning it with the Developer Fundamentals course. Key enhancements include revised login instructions, improved module learning outcomes, module summaries, and additional slides on previously omitted topics. The course has been tested to ensure accurate instructions and time estimates.

The course is organized into four modules, each with specific learning outcomes:

- **Module 1** — Using ValidMind for Model Validation
- **Module 2** — Running Data Quality Tests
- **Module 3** — Developing Challenger Models
- **Module 4** — Finalizing Validation Reports

This training series introduces the basics of using ValidMind for dataset and model validation. It includes running and logging tests with the ValidMind Library and finalizing your model's validation report in the ValidMind Platform. You will learn to automate testing, populate evidence in your validation report, track finding resolution, and more. Register to take the course now!
