The **Validator Fundamentals** course has been updated for clarity and comprehensiveness, aligning it with the Developer Fundamentals course. Updates include revised login instructions, enhanced learning outcomes, module summaries, and additional content on previously omitted topics. The course has been tested for accuracy in instructions and time estimates.

The course is divided into four modules with specific learning outcomes:

- **Module 1**: Using ValidMind for Model Validation
- **Module 2**: Running Data Quality Tests
- **Module 3**: Developing Challenger Models
- **Module 4**: Finalizing Validation Reports

This training series covers the basics of using ValidMind for dataset and model validation. It includes running and logging tests with the ValidMind Library and finalizing validation reports on the ValidMind Platform.
