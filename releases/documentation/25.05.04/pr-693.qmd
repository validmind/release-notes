This update adds a feature to the documentation, allowing users to export ongoing monitoring documentation for models. The new section provides step-by-step instructions for using the user interface to perform this export. Users should:

- Click `Inventory` in the left sidebar.
- Select a model or use filters/search to find one.
- Click `Ongoing Monitoring` in the model's sidebar.
- Click `Export Document` in the right sidebar.
- Download the file by clicking `Download File`.

This enhancement aims to improve documentation usability by offering clear export instructions.
