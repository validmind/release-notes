This update adds a feature to the documentation, allowing users to export ongoing monitoring documentation for models. The new section provides step-by-step instructions for navigating the user interface to perform this export. Users should:

- Click on `Inventory` in the left sidebar.
- Select a model or use filters/search to find a model.
- Click on `Ongoing Monitoring` in the model's sidebar.
- Click on `Export Document` in the right sidebar.
- Download the file locally by clicking `Download File`.

This enhancement aims to improve documentation usability by offering clear instructions for exporting ongoing monitoring reports.
