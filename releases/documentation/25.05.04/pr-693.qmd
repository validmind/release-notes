# PR Summary

This pull request introduces a new feature to the documentation that allows users to export ongoing monitoring documentation for models. The new section provides step-by-step instructions on how to navigate the user interface to export this documentation. Specifically, it guides users to:

1. Click on **Inventory** in the left sidebar.
2. Select a model or use filters/search to find a model.
3. Click on **Ongoing Monitoring** in the model's sidebar.
4. Click on **Export Document** in the right sidebar.
5. Download the file locally by clicking **Download File**.

This enhancement aims to improve the usability of the documentation by providing clear instructions for exporting ongoing monitoring reports.
